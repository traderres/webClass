How to Run a SQL query and convert the results to CSV
-----------------------------------------------------

Solution:  Use the \copy command


Approach #1:  Run the \copy command to send the results to STDOU
psql> \copy (select id, to_char(created, 'mm/dd/YYYY') as created_date from reports) TO STDOUT With CSV;

Approach #2:  Run the \copy command to send the results to a file
psql>  \copy (select id, to_char(created, 'mm/dd/YYYY') as created_date from reports) TO /tmp/stuff.csv With CSV;

Approach #3:  Run the \copy command to send the results to a file with headers
psql> \copy (select id, to_char(created, 'mm/dd/YYYY') as created_date from reports) TO /tmp/stuff.csv With CSV HEADER;


NOTE:  Make sure the you have a backwards slash in \copy




Approach #4:  Use a SQL file and the Copy Command
-------------------------------------------------
 1. Create the SQL that will generate the csv file along with headers
    unix> vi /tmp/generate.sql

		 -- Use the "copy" command to run this SQL statement and sent the output to STDOUT
		 copy (

				select cs.id, cs.cage_code, cs.is_uploaded_contract as is_uploaded_dd254,
				from contract_specification cs
				order by 1 desc

		   )  TO STDOUT With CSV HEADER;


 2. Run the SQL to generate the csv file
    unix> psql -U app1_user -h localhost -d app1_db < /tmp/generate.sql > /tmp/output.csv
