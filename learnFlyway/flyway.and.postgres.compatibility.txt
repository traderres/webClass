What versions of Flyway work with versions of Postgres?
-------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I have some developers using Postgres 9.6 and others using Postgres 15.6
          Is there a flyway version that works with both?
          SHORT ANSWER:  Yes, use flyway 6.5.7  [but it's not ideal]



On 04/30/2024, B and I figured this out:

Facts
-----
  Flyway 5.2.4 does not work with Postgres 15.6 / you will get the pg_proc.proisadd does not exist error

  Flyway 6.5.7 will work with Postgres 9.6 and 15.4 and 15.6
               NOTE:  We get warnings with Postgres 15.4

  Flyway 5.2.4 works with AWS postgres 15.4   [which is really surprising]
  Flyway 5.2.4 works with Postgres 9.6

  Flyway 9.22.3 works with Postgres 15.4 on AWS and Postgres 15.6
  WARNING:  If you set your connection pool to 1, then app will blow-up because it cannot get a 2nd connection
            Flyway 9.22.3 needs to have a connection pool of 2 or greater



Compatibility Matrix
--------------------

						 Flyway			    Flyway			 Flyway
						 v5.2.4             v6.5.7			 v9.22.3

		Postgres 9.6     Works              Works            does not work


	AWS	Postgres 15.4    Works              Works            Works
		                                    w/warnings


		Postgres 15.6    Does not work      Works            Works
		                                    w/warnings



Conclusions
-----------
 A) If you need to use Postgres 9.6 and 15, then use flyway v6.5.7
    NOTE:  You will have to set the flyway.cleanDisabled(false) in code

                // Initialize the flyway object by setting the data source and schema name
                Flyway flyway = Flyway.configure()
                        .dataSource(dataSource)
                        .schemas(schemaName)
                        .cleanDisabled(false)          // This is needed in flyway v6.5.7 or later
                        .load();


				Add this to your db-migrations / pom.xml   [so that it can run flyway clean]

					<properties>
					   <flyway.cleanDisabled>false</flyway.cleanDisabled>
					</properties>


 B) If you only need Postgres 15.4 or 15.6, then use flyway v9.22.3

 C) If you find yourself with connection errors  (timeout after 30 seconds, then verify that your connection pool is only 1 connection -- it might need to be bigger)
