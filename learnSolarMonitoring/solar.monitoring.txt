What to monitor for

Procedure
---------
 1. Login to https://monitoring.solaredge.com/

 2. What to look for
    a. site communication
    b. issues w/inverter or power optimizer
    c. under-performing powers


Case 1:  No production after 72 hours
 a. Reboot the interter (if it is successful, it may take 24 hours for the data to upload)
 b. If the issue persists, contact solar edge to start a case



If you see a panel not reporting data, contact solar edge as well.

If solar edge cannot help, then reach out to the panel manufacturer (WinAico)
    


Inverter Details
----------------
Go to Layout
Right-click on the inverter -> Alerts



Optimizers (Panels themselves)
------------------------------
Go to Layout
Right-click on a panel -> Alerts


New Alert System
----------------
Email notifications sent via solar edge software
Go to Alerts -> View the Alerts
-- I cannot set my own alerts


Return Merchanide Authorization (RMA) on Warranty Parts
-------------------------------------------------------
If an optimizer goes bad, you reach out to solar edge
You inform the installer (MSSI) will need the installation address, case #

So, if there is a problem, talk to SolarEdge first and then talk to MSSI second (as MSSI would be installing the part)


You can chat with solaredge (more effective than calling)
