How to Increase the Postgres Connections on BDP 4
--------------------------------------------------
Problem:  We need to increase the number of connections *PER USER* to 1500


Procedure
---------
 1. Get the current number of connections-per-user in postgres
    ssh to the puppet master
    unix> go postgres_server
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> psql -U postgres -h localhost

    	SELECT rolname, rolconnlimit FROM pg_roles;

    	\q;


 2. Increase the number of connections-per-user to 1500
    NOTE:  Need to edit and run that script to set the role connection limit to 1500
    a. ssh to puppet msater

    b. Edit the file
       unix> vi /var/bdp/upgrade/pg_user_connection_limit.sh

	c. Change this line
	   per_user_connlimit=1500

    d. Run the script
       unix> . /var/bdp/upgrade/pg_user_connection_limit.sh

       NOTE:  Puppet will restore the script back to its original setting after it finished


 3. Verify that the  current number of connections-per-user in postgres is now 1500
    ssh to the puppet master
    unix> go postgres_server
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> psql -U postgres -h localhost

    	SELECT rolname, rolconnlimit FROM pg_roles;

    	\q;

 4. Use the RDA Deployer to start-up the webapp

 5. Verify that the webapp can startup
