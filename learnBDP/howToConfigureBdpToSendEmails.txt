How to Configure BDP To Send Emails
-----------------------------------

NOTE:  See howToSendEmails.txt for how to create an EmailService that runs in spring-boot


Procedure 1:  Web App talks to localhost SMTP server on port 25
---------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Setup the BDP such that the nodes have a rbr-tech.com domain name

 2. Install the opendkim software and dependencies
    https://tecadmin.net/setup-domainkeys-dkim-on-postfix-centos-rhel/
    http://www.opendkim.org/

 3. Created a bdp unix account called "noreply"

 4. Configure the EmailService in the webapp to look for the smtp server on localhost
     -Demail.smtp.host.url=http://localhost:25

 5. Startup the webapp (it was running on dn01)

 6. No changes were made to iptables  (ip tables is turned on)

 7. Set the "From" email address to be an existing BDP unix account – e.g., noreply@puppet.rbr-tech.com
   – Email made it to my mail.mil with the from address as noreply






Procedure 2:  Web App talks to Proxy server's SMTP server   (so we need to open up proxy server port 25)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Adjust the puppet scripts to add an iptables rule to open up port 25 (so proxy server will accept TCP/IP packets on port 25)

	ssh to puppet master

	unix> sudo -s
	unix> vi /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/proxy/manifests/external.pp

    Change this entry:
		iptables::listen::tcp_stateful {
		   'proxy_server_port_external':
			 $trusted_nets => $trusted_nets,
			 dports => $proxy::listen_port;
		}


    To this:
		iptables::listen::tcp_stateful {
		   'proxy_server_port_external':
			 $trusted_nets => $trusted_nets,
			 dports => $proxy::listen_port;

			'proxy_server_smtp':
			 $trusted_nets => $trusted_nets,
			 dports => [25];
		}


 2. Run puppet agent against the proxy server
	unix> yarcs -r proxy_server   # run from the puppet master

    *OR*

	ssh to proxy_server
	unix> puppet agent -t


 3. Verify the change was applied by running iptables
    unix> iptables -L -n

    -- We should see an extra line
			Accept tcp - 0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0   state new tcp multiport dports 25 /* SIMP */


 4. Watch the proxy server log file
    ssh to proxy server
    tail -f /var/log/maillog


 5. Change the NCCS Web App's Email "From Address" to use the external domain name of this cluster:
    NOTE:  This must be the **EXTERNALLL domain name

  	-Demail.from.address=noreply@EXTERNAL.DOMAIN.NAME.COM


 6. We put the webapp in demo mode and sent an email out and we received it.
