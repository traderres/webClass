How to Increase the ElasticSearch Thread Pool Size on BDP 4
-----------------------------------------------------------
The NCCS webapp needs a larger thread pool size.  Follow these steps to increase the ES thread pool limits


Procedure
---------
 1. Get the current thread pool number
	unix> ssh to the puppet msater
	unix> go elastic_masters_primary
    unix> sudo -s
	unix> grep -A 7 thread_pool /etc/elasticsearch/primary/elasticsearch.yml

	You should see the current thread pool

	thread_pool:
	  write:
		queue_size: 200
	  search:
		queue_size: 1000
	  get:
		queue_size: 1000




 2. Set the thread pool values
 	unix> ssh to the puppet msater
	unix> sudo -s
    unix> vi /etc/puppetlabs/code/modules/bdp_elasticsearch/data/default.yaml

	Change the line so that it looks like this:

	# Thread pools
    thread_pool:
      write:
        queue_size: 20000
      search:
        queue_size: 40000
      get:
        queue_size: 5000


 3. Update the roles (on the puppet master)
    unix> /var/bdp/bin/bdp_roles -o


 4. Push-out this change to the nginx server immdiately
    unix> su - aresnick    # on the puppet master
    unix> yarcs -r elastic_masters_primary -v   # Run as a non-root account
    unix> yarcs -r elastic_workers_primary -v   # Run as a non-root account


 5. Verify that the nginx.conf file was updated
	unix> ssh to the puppet msater
	unix> go elastic_masters_primary
    unix> sudo -s
	unix> grep -A 7 thread_pool /etc/elasticsearch/primary/elasticsearch.yml

	You should see the current thread pool

	# Thread pools
    thread_pool:
      write:
        queue_size: 20000
      search:
        queue_size: 40000
      get:
        queue_size: 5000


 6. Restart ElasticSearch on all nodes
    unix> ssh to the puppet master
    unix> cd /var/bdp/bin
    unix> yarcs -r elastic_masters_primary -c "sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch_primary" -v      # Run as a non-root account
    unix> yarcs -r elastic_workers_primary -c "sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch_primary" -v      # Run as a non-root account
