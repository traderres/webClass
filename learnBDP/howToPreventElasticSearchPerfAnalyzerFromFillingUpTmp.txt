How to Prevent the BDP Performance Analyzer Service from creating massive log files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  The /tmp directory is filled-up with massive log files from the ElasticSearch Performance Analyzer service


Short Term Fix
--------------
Erase the /tmp files and restart the service
 1. ssh to the puppet master

 2. go datanodes

 3. unix> sudo -s
    unix> df -h /tmp       # Look at the disk space that is being used in /tmp

 4. Erase the 2 large files  (that were using-up all of the disk space in /tmp)
    unix> rm /tmp/performance_analyzer_agent_stats.log
    unix> rm /tmp/PerformanceAnalyzer.log

 5. Restart the ElasticSearch service
    unix> systemctl restart elasticsearch_primary_performance_analyzer

 6. Look at the amount of disk space in /tmp
    unix> df -h /tmp




Long Term Fix
-------------
 1. ssh to the puppet master

 2. edit the /etc/bdp/config.yaml

    Add this entry:

bdp_elasticsearch::performance_analyzed_instances:
  - ""


    When finished, the end of the file should look something like this:

bdp_config::kafka_disk_size_gb: 15
bdp_config::kafka_ingest_partitions: '2'
bdp_elasticsearch::performance_analyzed_instances:
  - ""
bdp_logstash::es_index_expiry: 3



 3. Push the changes out
    unix> bdp roles -o
