How to Verify that you can reach External SAM Site from BDP Command Line
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to verify that the BDP cluster can reach the external https://api.sam.gov/ url.
So, I want to connect to an external URL using https from the command line

If the command-line can reach an external site, then the webapps definitely can, too.

Assumptions:
 A) Your current SAM API key is TqmJeKYbSUi4dJWALTH3jqygecOalo0srefV1FtK
 B) You want to connect to an external url from the BDP command-line


Procedure
---------
 1. SSH to the puppet master

 2. Enter this command to reach the external https://api.sam/gov/ site
    unix> curl -k --cert /etc/pki/simp/x509/private/`hostname`.pem 'https://api.sam.gov/entity-information/v2/entities?api_key=TqmJeKYbSUi4dJWALTH3jqygecOalo0srefV1FtK&cageCode=6ky98'

    -- You should get real output
