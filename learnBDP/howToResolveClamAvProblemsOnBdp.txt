How to Resolve Virus Scanner Problems on BDP
--------------------------------------------

Problem:  Webapp will not start because Virus Scanner is down
          Clam AV would not startup because "version of curl is too low please use tcp socket streaming instead"


Solution:  Identify which clamav did not startup and attempt to restart



Procedure
---------
 1. Check the status of clamav on all nodes
    unix> yarcs -vc "sudo systemctl status clamd-stream"



 2. Check which clam-av services are active
    unix> yarcs -r bdp_nodemanagers -c "sudo systemctl is-active clamd-stream" -v
    -- Should show which IP has an inactive status


 3. Ssh to that box
    unix> sudo systemctl status clamd-stream
    unix> sudo systemctl start clamd-stream


 4. Verify it's listening using ss (instead of netstat)
    unix> ss -lnt | grep 3310

   LISTEN 0      128             127.0.0.1:3310       0.0.0.0:*


 5. Use the RDA Deployer to restart the webapps
    -- They should be able to talk to the clam-av virus scanner now
