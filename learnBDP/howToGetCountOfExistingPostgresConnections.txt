How to Get a Count of Existing Postgres Connections In Use on BDP 4
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I need to know how many connections are IN USE right now



Solution
--------
 1. Ssh to the puppet master
    unix> go postgres_server       # connect to the postgres server

 2. On the postgres server, run a SQL query to determine what user's are using postgres connections
    unix> sudo -s
    unix> cd
    unix> psql -U postgres


    select usename, count(usename) from pg_stat_activity group by usename order by 2 desc;
    \q
