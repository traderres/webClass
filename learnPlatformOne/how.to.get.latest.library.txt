Platform One Techniques
-----------------------
Problem:  My projects depend on another project -- e.g., core-library, foci-library
          When I "publish" the core-library, it is not available to other projects


Solution: Adjust other projects to clear the maven cache for this core-library and foci-library
For your projects that depend on a library -- e.g., core-library or foci-library


Procedure
---------
On the Platform One side, add this to your other projects:
  mvn dependency:purge-local-repository -DmanualInclude=gov.dcsa:core-library,gov.dcsa:foci-library
