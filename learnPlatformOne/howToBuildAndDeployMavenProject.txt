https://repo1.dso.mil/platform-one/onboarding/big-bang/sample-pipeline


Assumptions
-----------
 A) You want your web apps built using OpenJDK 17 and Maven 3.3.9
 B) You want your web apps to run using openJDK 17
 C) You have access to the IL2 Gitlab
 D) You have pushed-up the project to IL2 Gitlab


Procedure
---------
 1. Clone your project

 2. Add the Dockerfile in the root
    unix> vi Dockerfile

		 FROM registry1.dso.mil/ironbank/redhat/openjdk/openjdk17:1.17

		 USER 1001

		 COPY backend/target/*.jar /app/

		 ENTRYPOINT ["java","-Dspring.main.lazy-initialization=true","-Dspring.jmx.enabled=false","-jar","/app/backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT-exec.jar"]


 1. Submit a general ticket to setup the pipeline
    a. Go to https://jira.il2.dso.mil/servicedesk/customer/portal/73/create/355
    b. Fill in the ticket
       Summary:  	  Request to setup a pipeline for the reference-app webapp
       Impact Level:  IL2
       Project URL:   https://code.il2.dso.mil/platform-one/products/DCSA/reference-app

       Description:

			I want to setup a pipeline so that this web app can be built and deployed.


			In order to build the web app, you need 2 things:
			 1)  Maven 3.9 and OpenJDK 17 compiler.  The maven-openjdk-17 container in Ironbank has what is needed:

			registry1.dso.mil/ironbank/opensource/maven/maven-openjdk-17:3.9.9-amazoncorretto-17


			 2) The maven build command is as follows

				 mvn clean package -Pprod



			There is a Dockerfile in the Gitlab project that can be used for running the container.

			If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thank you.

 6. Setup a general ticket to setup a keycloak container
    a. Go to https://jira.il2.dso.mil/servicedesk/customer/portal/73/create/355
    b. Fill in the ticket
       Summary:  	  Request to setup a container running Keycloak
       Impact Level:  IL2
       Project URL:   https://code.il2.dso.mil/platform-one/products/DCSA/reference-app

       Description:

I need a container running Keycloak.  The intent is to have this Keycloak run behind the Platform One Keycloak.  However, this 2nd keycloak will trust our certificate authority.

Our developers and testers need to connect to our web applications with multiple accounts at the same time.  We want them to have multiple PKI client certificates.

We will create the certificate authority.  We will create the PKI client certificates.  And, I can add the CA trust file to this keycloak (running in a container).

Once Keycloak is running, we can configure it.  But, I will need your setting-up this Keycloak so it stands behind your primary keycloak.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thank you.
