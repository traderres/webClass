Java Lesson:  Learn Collections
-------------------------------
Most frequently used collections are the List and Map
  1. Map   holds unique keys and values
  2. List  holds an ordered list of Objects



Working with Lists
------------------

List      is an interface
ArrayList is a concrete object that we work with

Map  is an interface
HashMap is a concrete object that we work with
TreeMap is a concrete object that we work with



 		ArrayList<String> myList = null;         myList is a null object that might references a list of strings

 		ArrayList<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();    // MyList is an *empty* list


 		myList.add("this");      	// myList has a size of 1
 		myList.add("that");			// myList has a size of 2
 		myList.add("other thing");	// myList has a size of 3



How to Loop through a list of objects
-------------------------------------

	for (String item: myList) {
		logger.debug("item={}", item);
	}
