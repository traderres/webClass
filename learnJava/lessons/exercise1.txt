Today's Exercise
----------------
 1. Create a new object called EditReportDTO

 2. inside this class, I want a fields

		id      integer
		name    string
		priority integer


 3. I want you to make a new test method
    -- in AppTest, create another method.  It's got to be public and it can't have any passed-in parameters
	-- It has to have the @Test annotation above it


 4. Inside this new test method
	a. Create a copy of your EditReportDTO object
	b. Set some values
	c. Display the values in a logger



	Static
		really means "of the class"


		static methods in a class don't require you to use new






	final
	1. Make a new class called MathUtils

	2. Add a static method add


		public static int add(int aValue1, int aValue2) {
			int sum = aValue1 + aValue2;

			return sum;
		}



	3. Call this static method in your newest test method:    appTest.testTwo()

		int a = 25;
		int b = 15;
		int sum = MathUtils.add(a, b);

		// Use a logger to display the values in the console of a, b, and sum
