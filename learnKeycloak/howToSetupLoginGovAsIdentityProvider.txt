How to integrate with Login.gov
-------------------------------
 1. Your integration with Login.gov starts in the dashboard where you can register your app.
 2. Determine your application needs, like the level of proofing and user attributes that will be requested.
 3. Select between Open ID Connect (OIDC) or SAML implementation protocols.
 4. Configure your app in the dashboard and start testing! We have implementation guides and example apps to get you up and running quickly.
 5. When you are ready to go live our team will help you promote the application to production. We will check against our production checklist to ensure your application is ready for production from an administrative and technical standpoint.





Approach #1 / Use OpenID Connect
--------------------------------
 1. Setup a login.gov "Sandbox account"
    a. Go to https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov/
    b. Select the "Sign-in" button to create a new account
       Anyone with a .gov or .mil email address may request an account
	c. Next to "Create your first team", press "Continue"

    d. In the "New Team" page
    	Name:   	SIT_WebApp_Team
    	Agency: 	Department of Defense
		Press "Create"

	e. Select Apps (on the top menubar)
	   *OR*
	   https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov/service_providers

	f. Press "Create a new app"

	g. In the "New App" page
		Dashboard Configuration:  	Sandbox
		App name            		My SIT Web App  				  (does not matter)
		Friendly name:				SIT Web App  					  (displayed to users when logging in)
		Team:               		SIT_WebApp_Team
		Authentication Protocol:	OpenID Connect Private Key JWT    (preferred for web apps)
		Level of Service:			Identity verification permitted   (so the webapp will receive verified attributes)
		Default Auth Assurance Lvl	MFA Required, remember device disallowed (AAL2)

		Attribute bundle:  [check these] / Do not check SSN
			email
			x509_subject
			x509_presented
			first_name
			last_name
			dob
			address1
			address2
			city
			state
			zipcode
			phone

		Issuer:					urn:gov:gsa:openidconnect.profiles:sp:sso:<AGENCY_NAME>:<APP_NAME>
								Replace AGENCY_NAME with DCSA
								Replace APP_NAME    with sit_webapp
                                urn:gov:gsa:openidconnect.profiles:sp:sso:dcsa:sit_webapp

		Failure to Proof URL	https://www.google.com/

		Push notification URL:  <blank>

		Redirect URIs:          https://dev1.rbr-tech.us/cvf/

		Accessible:				Yes

		Press "Create app"






Approach #2 / Use SAML
----------------------





Approach #3 / Use keycloak-login.gov-integration  (works for Keycloak 15)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This adds an Identity Provider called "login.gov"

I tried the pom.xml to use keycloak to version 22.0.1
-- Would not compile!!!!
