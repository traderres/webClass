How to Stop Keycloak from Having Concurrent Sessions
----------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I want to stop keycloak from creating concurrent sessions
Solution: Add a flow and set your OIDC provider to use it in the post-logout flow

Assumptions:
 A) You have Keycloak setup
 B) You are using an OIDC provider in keycloak to authenticate
 C) You have admin access to keycloak

Procedure
---------
 1. Connect to your Keycloak Admin console

 2. Create an flow called "User Session Limiter"
    a. Change to your realm
    b. Click on MyRealm -> Authentication
    c. Press "create Flow"
    d. In the "Create flow" page
       Name:       User Session Limiter
       Flow Type:  Basic Flow
       Press "Create"

    e. Press "Add execution"
    f. Select "User session count limiter"
       Press "Add"

    g. Change the "Disabled" dropdown to "Required"

    h. Press "Gear" icon to edit the settings of this flow
       Alias:  user-session-limiter
       Maximum concurrent sessions for each user within this realm:    3
       Maximum concurrent sessions for each user per keycloak client:  1
       Behavior when user session limit is exceeded:                   Terminate oldest session
       Press "Save"

 3. Apply your flow to your OIDC provider
    a. Go to Identity Providers -> My Identity Provider
    b. Post login flow:  "User Session Limiter"
    c. Press "Save"
