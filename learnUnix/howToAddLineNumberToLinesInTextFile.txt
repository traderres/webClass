How to Add Line Numbers to Lines in a Text File
-----------------------------------------------
Problem:  I have 5000 records in a csv file
          And, I want to add a line number to the beginning of each line

Solution:  Use the nl command


Procedure
---------
 1. Create a temporary file
    unix> vi /tmp/not-numbered.txt

    'John', 'CEO'
    'Jacob', 'Chief of Marketing'
    'George', 'Head of IT'



 2. Add numbers to the line  (starting with line 1)
    USAGE:
       The -v1 means start with 1
       The -p  means ignore page breaks
       The -ba means add numbering all lines

    unix> nl -v1 -p -ba  /tmp/not-numbered.txt

    You would see this output:
     1	    'John', 'CEO'
     2	    'Jacob', 'Chief of Marketing'
     3	    'George', 'Head of IT'



  3. Add numbers to the line followed by a comma
     unix> nl -v1 -p -ba -s "," /tmp/not-numbered.txt

     You would see this output:
	  1,    'John', 'CEO'
	  2,    'Jacob', 'Chief of Marketing'
	  3,    'George', 'Head of IT'
