How to fix SSH Too Many Authentication Failures on CentOS
---------------------------------------------------------

Problem:  On Monday morning, I could not ssh to other servers using either ssh or putty
Solution: Add password entries to the ~/.ssh/config for the ones that require passwords


What Happened
-------------
 1. On Sunday, I added a 4th entry to ~/.ssh/config for a new gitlab instance and added an EXTRA new line at the end
 2. On Monday, I could not ssh to other boxes
 3. I tried updating the ssh and openssl libraries
    unix> sudo dnf update openssh
    unix> sudo dnf update openssl

    But, the problem remained

 4. On Monday, I debugged the problem
    unix> ssh -vT aresnick@10.1.24.100

    It shows that it is attempting to apply all of the config entries
    So, it's trying too many attempts


The Fix
-------
 1. Fix ssh on command-line by dding these entries to the TOP of the config file (as these entries are using password authentication)
    unix> vi ~/.ssh/config

		Host 64.296.246.107
		   User aresnick
		   PreferredAuthentications keyboard-interactive,password

		Host 10.1.*
		   User aresnick
		   PreferredAuthentications keyboard-interactive,password


 2. Fix for putty
    a. Startup Putty
    b. Change putty configurations for Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> Set "Attempt authentication using Pageant" is NOT checked
    c. Change putty configurations for Connection -> SSH -> Auth -> Set "Attempt keyboard-interactive" auth    is checked
