How to fix SSH Too Many Authentication Failures on CentOS
---------------------------------------------------------

Problem:  On Monday morning, I could not ssh to other servers using either ssh or putty
Solution: Add password entries to the ~/.ssh/config for the ones that require passwords


What Happened
-------------
 1. On Sunday, I added a 4th entry to ~/.ssh/config for a new gitlab instance and added an EXTRA new line at the end
 2. On Monday, I could not ssh to other boxes
 3. I tried updating the ssh and openssl libraries
    unix> sudo dnf update openssh
    unix> sudo dnf update openssl

    But, the problem remained

 4. On Monday, I debugged the problem
    unix> ssh -vT aresnick@10.1.24.100

    It shows that it is attempting to apply all of the config entries
    So, it's trying too many attempts


The Fix
-------
Add these entries to the TOP of the config file (as these entries are using password authentication)

Host 64.296.246.107
   User aresnick
   PreferredAuthentications password

Host 10.1.*
   User aresnick
   PreferredAuthentications password
