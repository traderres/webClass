How to fix SSH Too Many Authentication Failures on CentOS
---------------------------------------------------------

Problem:  On Monday morning, I could not ssh to other servers using either ssh or putty
Solution: Remove the empty line at the end of your ~/.ssh/config text file


What Happened
-------------
 1. On Sunday, I added an entry to ~/.ssh/config for a new gitlab instance and added an EXTRA new line at the end
 2. On Monday, I could not ssh to other boxes
 3. I tried updating the ssh and openssl libraries
    unix> sudo dnf update openssh
    unix> sudo dnf update openssl

    But, the problem remained

 4. On Monday, I removed the EXTRA line at the end of the config files
    -- And, then I could ssh to the other boxes
