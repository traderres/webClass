How to recover centos 8 grub boot loader
----------------------------------------
Problem:  I have a dual Windows 10 / Centos 8 laptop
          And, a Windows 10 update destroyed the master boot record
          -- So, I lost the grub boot loader

Procedure
---------
 1. Create USB thumbdrive with Centos 8 Stream distribution
    a. Download the iso file from here:
            https://mirror.umd.edu/centos/8-stream/isos/x86_64/CentOS-Stream-8-x86_64-latest-dvd1.iso

    b. Burn the ISO to a file
       See learnCentOS / howToInstallCentos8_onDellPrecision / Step1 & Step2

 2. Disable Secure Boot in the bios of the computer
    Startup the laptop
    Press F12
    Select BIOS
    Disable Secure Boot in the BIOS

 3. Boot from thumbdrive

 4. In the menu
    Select Troubleshoot
    Select Rescue a CentOS Stream system

 5. Press 1 to Continue
    Enter encrypted hard drive password

    NOTE:  Wait 60 seconds for the hard-drive to decrypt

    Press <Enter> to open a shell


 6. In the shell, run these command
    unix> chroot /mnt/sysroot


 7. Rebuild grub without the os prober
    unix> vi /etc/default/grub

      # Add this entry
      GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER="true"

    unix> cd /sbin
    unix> grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg

    You should see
      Adding boot entry for EFI firmware configuration



 8. Rebuild grub with the os prober   (so it finds the Windows option)
    unix> vi /etc/default/grub

      # Add this entry
      GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER="false"

    unix> cd /sbin
    unix> grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg

    You should see
          Found Windows Boot Manager on /dev/.....
          Adding boot menu entry for EFI firmware configuration


    unix> exit
    unix> exit        # will cause a reboot


     During Reboot  you should see the Centos Grub Menu



 9. Startup Windows (1st time)
    a. Restart the computer
    b. In the grub boot menu, select Windows Boot Loader
    c. Enter the bitlocker recovery key   (because we changed the master boot record)
       -- Verify that Windows Comes up
    d. Shutdown


10. Startup Centos 8  (1st time)
    a. Restart the computer
    b. In the grub boot menu, select CentOS 8

       NOTE:  On the first reboot, Centos will say SElinux targeted policy relabel is required

    c. Centos 8 will restart for you (automatically)
       -- This time is should startup quickly




NOTE:  I was unable to get this to work with Secure Boot **AND** dual-booting Windows & CentOS 8 Stream as of 9/8/2022
       Instead of dual boot, use 2 different laptops -- one for Windows and one for Linux
