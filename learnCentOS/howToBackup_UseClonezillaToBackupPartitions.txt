Assumptions:
 A) You have a flash drive (for creating a Clonezilla Live distribution)
 B) You have a backup device
 C) You want to backup your Centos Linux partitions to the backup device


Procedure (to backup your partitions to a backup device)
--------------------------------------------------------
 1. Download the Clonezilla USB Live ISO
    a. Go to http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable
       1) CPU architecture:  Select "amd64" (for Intel chips)
       b) File Type:         Select "iso"
       c) Repository:        Select "auto"

    b. Press "Download"
    c. Save clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso to your ~/Downloads directory

 2. Write the Clonezilla USB Live ISO to your USB flash drive
    a. Connect your flash drive to your computer

    b. Run fdisk to identify the device id
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> fdisk -l

       In my case, I see my 32 GB flash drive as /dev/sdg
            Disk /dev/sdg: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
            Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
            Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            Disk label type: dos
            Disk identifier: 0x31f1464f

    c. Setup the FAT32 filesystem on your USB flash drive
       unix> umount /dev/sdg1
             *or*
             umount /dev/sdg
       unix> mkfs.vfat /dev/sdg -I -v

    d. Use dd to write the clonezilla ISO file to your USB flash drive device
       unix> cd ~/Downloads
       unix> dd if=clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso  of=/dev/sdg status=progress bs=8MB && sync


  3. Connect your backup hard-drive to your computer
     Connect your CloneZilla USB live flash drive
     Reboot

  4. Boot your computer from the CloneZilla USB live flash drive
     If using Dell, press F12 on startup and select USB drive



Run Clonezilla to backup all partitions to a USB drive
------------------------------------------------------
 1. In the main cloneZilla menu, select "Other modes of Clonezilla Live"
	Select "Clonezilla live (VGA 800x600 & To RAM)"

 2. In the "Choose Language" screen, select English

 3. In the "Keyboard configuration" screen, select "Keep the default keyboard layout"

 4. In the "Start clonezilla" screen, select "Start Clonezilla"

 5. In the "Mode" screen, select "device-image"

 6. In the "Mount Clonezilla image directory" screen, select "local_dev"
	-- We are going to save everything to a local USB disk


 7. Attach your USB device image repository (which will hold your backup partitions)
	Wait about 5 seconds
	Press Enter

 8. In the scan window screen, wait until you see your usb device
	then press Ctrl-C

 9. Select the partition where your image will be saved.
	-- In my case, it is sda 1.8T_vfat_There_are_di(In_Tech....)    // This is my 1.8 TB m2 drive (connected with USB port)

10. Choose if you want to check and repair the file system before mounting the image repository
    Choose "no-fsck / Skip checking"

11. Select a directory where the images will be saved to
	-- Because I formatted my USB drive, I will store it in the root
	   Path on the resource: /dev/sdc[/]
	   Current select dir name:  "/"
	-- Press Done

12. Select Expert Mode

13. Select "savedisk"

14. Give a name for your new image -- e.g., 2019-04-13-img-sda1
	NOTE:  On my linux laptop, I have 3 partitions, sda1, sda2, and sda3
		   So, I will call this one YYYY-MM-DD-img-sda1
		   -- e.g., 2019-04-13-img-sda1
    Press "Enter" to use the defaults image name -- e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-HH24.img

15. Select the source disk
    NOTE:  There was only 1 option

16. Tell Clonezilla which tools you want to use
	-- Use the defaults of  "-q2 Priority"  partclone > partimage > dd

17. Set extra parameters
	-- Use the default settings of -c and -j2

18. Select compression level
    -- Use the default settings of -z9p

19. Set a number larger than 10 to avoid split image in multiple files
	-- Use the default settings of 4096

20. In the Check and repair file system
	-- Use the default settings of "-sfcsk" skip checking/repairing source file system

21. After the image is saved
	-- Use the default settings of "Yes, check the saved image"

22. Do you want to encrypt the image?
	-- Use the default settings of "-senc not to encrypt the image"

23. In the action to perform when everything is finished
	-- Use the default settings of "-P choose"

24. You will be prompted with the command:
	Press "Enter" to continue

25. Are you sure you want to continue (y/n)
	Press Y to proceed

	Backup of the image should start
	-- You should see the status window

	When completed, your USB backup device will have a backup of the partition
