Assumptions:
 A) You have a flash drive (for creating a Clonezilla Live distribution)
 B) You have a backup device
 C) You want to backup your Centos Linux partitions to the backup device


Procedure (to backup your partitions to a backup device)
--------------------------------------------------------
 1. Download the Clonezilla USB Live ISO
    a. Go to http://clonezilla.org/downloads/download.php?branch=stable
       1) CPU architecture:  Select "amd64" (for Intel chips)
       b) File Type:         Select "iso"
       c) Repository:        Select "auto"

    b. Press "Download"
    c. Save clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso to your ~/Downloads directory

 2. Write the Clonezilla USB Live ISO to your USB flash drive
    a. Connect your flash drive to your computer

    b. Run fdisk to identify the device id
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> fdisk -l

       In my case, I see my 32 GB flash drive as /dev/sdg
            Disk /dev/sdg: 32.1 GB, 32086425600 bytes, 62668800 sectors
            Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
            Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
            Disk label type: dos
            Disk identifier: 0x31f1464f

    c. Setup the FAT32 filesystem on your USB flashdrive
       unix> umount /dev/sdg1
             *or*
             umount /dev/sdg
       unix> mkfs.vfat /dev/sdg -I -v

    d. Use dd to write the clonezilla ISO file to your USB flashdrive device
       unix> cd ~/Downloads
       unix> dd if=clonezilla-live-2.6.0-37-amd64.iso  of=/dev/sdg status=progress bs=8MB && sync


  3. Connect your backup hard-drive to your computer
     Connect your CloneZilla USB live flash drive
     Reboot

  4. Boot your computer from the CloneZilla USB live flash drive
     If using Dell, press F12 on startup and select USB drive


  5. You should see the Clonezilla Main Menu
     a. In the main cloneZilla menu, select "Other modes of Clonezilla Live"
        Select "Clonezilla live (To RAM)"
     b. In the "Choose Language" screen, select English
     c. In the "Keyboard configuration" screen, select "Keep the default keyboard layout"
     d. In the "Start clonezilla" screen, select "Start Clonezilla"
     e. In the "Mode" screen, select "device-image"
     f. In the "Mount Clonezilla image directory" screen, select "local_dev"
        -- We are going to save your partition to a local USB disk

     h. Attach your USB device image repository (which will hold your backup partitions)
        Wait about 5 seconds
        Press Enter

     i. In the scan window screen, wait until you see your usb device
        then press Ctrl-C

     h. Select the partition where your image will be saved.
        -- In my case, it is sdc 256 SSD

     i. Select a directory where the images will be saved to
        -- Because I formatted my USB drive, I will store it in the root
           Path on the resource: /dev/sdc[/]
           Current select dir name:  "/"
        -- Press Done

     k. Select Expert Mode

     l. Select "saveparts" to save a partition
     m. Give a name for your new image -- e.g., 2019-04-13-img-sda1
        NOTE:  On my linux laptop, I have 3 partitions, sda1, sda2, and sda3
               So, I will call this one YYYY-MM-DD-img-sda1
               -- e.g., 2019-04-13-img-sda1

     n. Select the source partition -- sda1
        NOTE:  If you named your image sda1, then choose sda1 as the source


     o. Tell Clonezilla which tools you want to use
        Select "-q2 Priority"  partclone > partimage > dd

     p. Set extra parameters
        -- Use the default settings of -c and -j2

     q. Select compression level
        -- Use the default settings of -z1p

     r. Set a number larger than 10 to avoid split image in multiple files
        -- Use the default settings of 4096

     s. In the Check and repair file system
        -- Use the default settings of "-sfcsk" skip checking/repairing source file system

     t. After the image is saved
        -- Use the default settings of "Yes, check the saved image"

     u. Do you want to encrypt the image?
        -- Use the default settings of "-senc not to encrypt the image"

     v. In the action to perform when everything is finished
        -- Use the default settings of "-P choose"

     w. You will be prompted with the command:
        Press "Enter" to continue

        Are you sure you want to continue (y/n)
        Press Y to proceed

        Backup of the image should start
        -- You should see the status window

        When completed, your USB backup device will have a backup of the partition
