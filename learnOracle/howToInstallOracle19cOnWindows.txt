 2. Enter your oracle user/password (or create one)

 3. Download the WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home.zip  file to your Downloads/ directory
    NOTE:  It's 3 GB in size

 4. Unzip the file in your Downloads/ directory
    -- Now, you have c:\users\MY_WINDOWS_USERNAME\downloads\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\



Part 2:  Run the Installer   (Fast Operation)
---------------------------------------------
 1. Run the setup.exe
    (Found in your c:\users\MY_WINDOWS_USERNAME\downloads\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\ directory)

 2. In the installer / Select Configuration Option
    Choose Setup software only

 3. In the installer / Database Installation Option

    Enter:  c:\tools\oracle

 7. Press "Install"

 8. Press "Close" to close it out




Part 3:  Use DBCA to Create a database called "mypdb"   (Takes 30 minutes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Run the dbca.bat script as *ADMINISTRATOR*
    a. Go to c:\users\MY_WINDOWS_USERNAME\downloads\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\bin\
	b. Right-click on dbca.bat -> Run as Administrator

 2. In the DBCA / Database Operation
    Choose "Create a database"

 3. In the DBCA / Creation Mode
    Choose "Typical Configuration"
	-- Set the administrative password to secret
	-- Confirm the password to secret
	-- Check "Create as container database"
	-- Pluggable Database Name:  mypdb


 4. You will get a warning saying the "ADMIN" password does not conform to the Oracle recommended details
    Press "Yes"

 5. Press "Finish"

 6. Press "Close"
    NOTE:  All database passwords except SYS and SYSTEM are locked




Part 4:  Use NETCA to create a tnsnames.ora
-------------------------------------------
 1. Run the netca.bat script as *ADMINISTRATOR*
    a. Go to c:\users\MY_WINDOWS_USERNAME\downloads\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\bin\
	b. Right-click on netca.bat -> Run as Administrator

 2. In the NETCA / Select "Listener Configuration"

 3. In the NETCA / Select "Add"

 4. In the NETCA / Set the listener name to LISTENER

 5. In the NETCA / Protocols
    Go with the default TCP (as the only selected protocol)

 6. In the NETCA / Port
    Use the standard port of 1521

 7. In the NETCA / Connect to another listener
    Select No

	NOTE:  Look in the terminal to see the progress

 8. In the NETCA / it should say "Listener configuration complete"
    Press "Next"
	Press "Finish"

    -- YOu should now have a tnsnames.ora in the C:\Users\MY_WINDOWS_USERNAME\Downloads\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\network\admin

 9. Get the service name
    a. open a terminal
	   TERMINAL> lsnrctl status

	b. Look for the listener that has the name "mypdb" in it
       -- This is your service name:   "mypdb.mshome.net"

   c. Edit the tnsnames.ora file and replace it with this:
      1) Edit c:\users\MY_WINDOWS_USERNAME\downloads\WINDOWS.X64_193000_db_home\network\admin\tnsnames.ora

      2) Replace its contents with this:

			ORCL =
			  (DESCRIPTION =
				(ADDRESS_LIST =
				  (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = localhost)(PORT = 1521))
				)
				(CONNECT_DATA =
				  (SERVER = DEDICATED)
				  (SERVICE_NAME = mypdb.mshome.net)
				)
			  )


   d. Verify the tnsping works
      terminal> tnsping orcle

	  You should get this:
	  Attempting to contact (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = localhost)(PORT = 1521))) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED) (SERVICE_NAME = mypdb.mshome.net)))
	  OK (0 msec)



Part 5:  Create a database user
-------------------------------
 1. Open a terminal
    terminal> sqlplus / as sysdba

 2. RUn these commands:
    SQLPLUS> alter session set container = mypdb;
	SQLPLUS> create user test_user identified by "secret";
	SQLPLUS> grant all privileges to test_user;
	SQLPLUS> grant connect to test_user;
	SQLPLUS> quit

 3. Attempt to login with your test_user account
    terminal> sqlplus test_user/secret@ORCL

	-- This should log you in immediately



Part 6:  Use IntelliJ to connect to it
--------------------------------------
 1. Startup Intellij

 2. Open the Database Settings

 3. Press + Data Source -> Oracle

 4. In the Oracle Data Source:
    a. Press "Download" to download the missing oracle driver

	b. Apply these settings:
			Connection Type:  	Service Name
			Host:				localhost
			Port:				1521
			Service:			mypdb.mshome.net               # This should match what was found running "lsnrctl status"

			Authentication:		User & Password
			User:				MY_USER
			Password:			secret
			Save:				Forever

	c. Press "Test Connection"
