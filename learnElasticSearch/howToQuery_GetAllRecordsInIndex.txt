How to Get All Records from an Index
------------------------------------


Procedure
---------
 1. Get all indexes
    GET /_all/_mapping


 2. Get the statistics about this index
    GET /user_db/_stats


 3. From one of those indexes, get all data
    GET /user_db/_search?size=<BIG_NUMBER>

    So, this query would get the first 10,000 records
    GET /user_db/_search?size=10000
