Exercise 1b:  Create a Report Index V2
--------------------------------------
We want to create a mapping called "reports"  that has a few fields:  actors, description, and priority
We want to populate it with some sample data

Improvement:  We want to do case-insensitive searches on the priority field


Exercises
---------
 1. Connect to your kibana console



 2. Delete the existing reports index (if it exists)



 3. Create a new reports index that holds 3 text fields:




 3. Populate the reports index with some data
 	  _id=1 / priority="low"  / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  John Smith        / description holds this:  he really likes o'reilly
  	  _id=2 / priority="LOW"  / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  george washington / description holds this:  depending on the kind query, you might want to go different ways with it
  	  _id=3 / priority="high" / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  adam Smith
  	  _id=4 / priority="HIGH" / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  Adam Smith 2      / description holds this:  This description is for record four
  	  _id=5 / priority="HIGH" / actors is an array that holds 3 names:                   / description holds this:  There are too many singers from the 1980s listed here.  Get a life!!
  	                                  Pat Benetar, Michael Jackson, and George Michael





 4. Search the priority field so it matches "HIGH", "high", "HiGH"  (case insensitive)




 5. Run a search and *SORT* by priority field
