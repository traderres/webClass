Exercise 1a:  Create a Report Index V1
--------------------------------------
We want to create a mapping called "reports"  that has a few fields:  actors, description, and priority
We want to populate it with some sample data




Exercises
---------
 1. Connect to your kibana console
    Go to http://localhost:5601/app/dev_tools#/console
    *OR*
    Go to http://localhost:5601/
    Press "Explore on my own"
    Press "Dev tools"




 2. Delete the existing reports index (if it exists)




 3. Create a new reports index that holds 3 text fields:
 		actors
 		description
 		priority




 4. Add a few records to your mapping:
  	  _id=1 / priority="low"  / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  John Smith        / description holds this:  he really likes o'reilly
  	  _id=2 / priority="LOW"  / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  george washington / description holds this:  depending on the kind query, you might want to go different ways with it
  	  _id=3 / priority="high" / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  adam Smith
  	  _id=4 / priority="HIGH" / actors is an array that holds 1 name:  Adam Smith 2      / description holds this:  This description is for record four
  	  _id=5 / priority="HIGH" / actors is an array that holds 3 names:                   / description holds this:  There are too many singers from the 1980s listed here.  Get a life!!
  	                                  Pat Benetar, Michael Jackson, and George Michael




 5. Search the reports index for everything




 6. Search the reports that have "GEORGE" in it




 7. Search multiple words




 8. Search multiple words with quotes -- e.g., "george washington"




 9. Search multiple words with default operator of OR




10. Search multiple words with default operator of AND




11. Search with wildcards




12. Search for records that have a non-null description




13. Search for records that have a null description




14. Search for records that have a high priority





Problem:  Our priority field has the priority in upper and lower case and it's a keyword
          How do I search for all high priority records (case-insensitive)
