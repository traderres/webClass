Boring Lecture:  Bulk Update Refresh Mode  (when are the changes going to be visible?)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 POST _bulk has some options that determine *WHEN* your changes are visible


 1, refresh=wait_for / Synchronous / The bulk update REST call **WAITS** for the next scheduled ES refresh to happen
    This does not force a refresh but rather waits for the next refresh to happen

        POST _bulk?refresh=wait_for

   + Once this call is finished, the results will be visible
   + We use this mode when doing updates as we want the REST call to *WAIT* for the bulk update to finis
     Consider:  We are in the Edit User page and update the user's name in the ES index
                We want the bulk update to *WAIT* for it to finish
                So, when the transaction is done, the changes will be visible in the "Manage Users" page


    - Can be expensive if you make multiple bulk updates.  Better to combine multiple ES bulk updates into one.



 2. refresh=false / Asynchronous / Changes will be made visible *AFTER THE NEXT* refresh interval
    When the fuck will I see my records?  The answer is determined by the index's refresh_interval (in seconds)
    NOTE:  This is **DEFAULT** behavior

        POST _bulk?refresh=false
        POST _bulk

    - Once this call is finished, the results will be *NOT* visible
    + Fastest
    + Useful if you have a program that needs to write a LOT of data to an index and does not need the changes to be visible IMMEDIATELY



 3. refresh=true / Synchronous / The bulk update REST call **FORCES A REFRESH**

        POST _bulk?refresh=true

    + Once this call is finished, the results will be visible
    - Very expensive operation  (It's better to refresh=wait_for and have the REST call wait for the next refresh interval)
