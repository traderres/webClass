		 *****  Plugin catchall_boolean (42.6 confidence) suggests   ******************

		 If you want to allow selinuxuser to execmod
		 Then you must tell SELinux about this by enabling the 'selinuxuser_execmod' boolean.

		 Do
		 setsebool -P selinuxuser_execmod 1

		 *****  Plugin catchall (5.76 confidence) suggests   **************************

		 If you believe that zoom should be allowed execmod access on the memfd:JITCode:QtQml (deleted) file by default.
		 Then you should report this as a bug.
		 You can generate a local policy module to allow this access.
		 Do
		 allow this access for now by executing:
		 # ausearch -c 'zoom' --raw | audit2allow -M my-zoom
		 # semodule -X 300 -i my-zoom.pp
