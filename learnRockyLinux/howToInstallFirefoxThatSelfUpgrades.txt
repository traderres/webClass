Part 2 / Update Firefox to use your favorite settings
-----------------------------------------------------
 1. Open Settings by Pulling Edit / Settings *OR* go to about:preferences

 2. Set the home page as blank
    a. On the left Choose "Home"
    		New Windows and Tabs
    			Home page and new Windows:  Blank Page
            	New Tabs:                   Blank Page

        	Firefox Home Content
        		Uncheck Web Search, Weather, Shortcuts, Recommended Stories, and Recent Activity

			History
				Never remember history

			Firefox Data Collection and Use
				Uncheck All

	c. In the General tab
			Browser Layout
				Uncheck "Show sidebar"


 3. Make sure you have the OpenH264 marked as "always activate"
    a. Pull Tools / Addons
	b. Select Plugins
	   -- You should see OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems
	c. Press the 3 dots -> Always Activate



Part 3 / Configure Firefox to work with a CAC
---------------------------------------------
 1. Change the crypto policy so that we do not use nss-p11-kit
 	unix> sudo cp /etc/crypto-policies/local.d/nss-p11-kit.config  /etc/crypto-policies/local.d/nss-p11-kit.config.OLD
 	unix> sudo rm /etc/crypto-policies/local.d/nss-p11-kit.config
 	unix> sudo update-crypto-policies
 	unix> sudo reboot


 2. Configure Firefox to use the opensc-pkcs11.so module (now that the p11-kit-proxy is not automatically loaded every time)
 	   a. Startup Firefox
 	   b. Pull Edit -> Settings
 	   c. Search for Security devices and press "Security Devices"
 	   d. In the "Device Manager"
 		   1) Press "Load"
 		   2) In the popup
 			  Module Name:      CAC Reader
 			  Module filename:  /usr/lib64/opensc-pkcs11.so
 			  Press OK


 3. Verify your browser works with CAC support by going to "mail.mil"
    a. Using firefox, go to https://webmail.apps.mil/mail
    b. You should be prompted to use your CAC
       -- Select your CAC
    c. You should see a message saying
       Your account has been successfully authenticated



 4. Problem:     Firefox and Chrome take 30 seconds to startup when CAC is inserted into built-in CAC reader
    Solution:    Tell opensc to only use the cac driver.  By default, opensc tries 35 drivers and that can take time
                 NOTE:  This worked with both CAC and ECA cards


     1. Edit the /open/sc.conf
        unix> sudo vi /etc/opensc.conf


     2. Add this line to the app default section:
            card_drivers = cac;


        When completed, the app default should start with that:
                app default {

                     # Tell opensc to only use this 1 driver
                     # NOTE:  To see all drivers that are supported,
                     #  1) Remove the card_drivers = ... from this file  *AND* reboot
                     #  2) Run this command:
                     #     unix> opensc-tool --list-drivers
                     card_drivers = cac;

                     ...
                }


     3. Reboot
        -- And, firefox and chrome startup much faster when a CAC is inserted
