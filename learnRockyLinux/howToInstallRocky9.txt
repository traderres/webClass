Procedure
---------
 1. Download the Rocky 9.4 ISO file
    a. Go to https://rockylinux.org/download
    b. Under Default Image v9.4, press "DVD ISO"
       *OR*
       Go to https://dl.rockylinux.org/vault/rocky/9.4/isos/x86_64/Rocky-9.4-x86_64-dvd.iso


 2. Use Ventoy to make a bootable ISO image that works with UEFI on older Dell computers:
    NOTE:  When I created the bootable Rocky Linux USB drive using the unix dd command, several problems appeared:
             Problem 1:  The rocky linux installer did not show a mount point called /boot/efi
             Problem 2:  The rocky linux installer showed this error: :  "boot loader failed to install.  System will not be bootable"
             Solution:   Use ventoy to install the ISO images

    If you are using Windows, follow these steps to make a bootable Rocky Linux 9 ISO with Ventoy
      a. Connect your USB drive to windows
      b. Format your USB drive
      c. Download Ventoy for Windows
      d. Unzip Ventoy
      e. Run ventoy2disk  (to install ventoy software on your USB drive
         1) Select the device that has your USB drive
         2) Press Install

      f. Drag and Drop your ISO to your USB drive
      g. Eject your USB drive
         -- It is now ready to boot



    If you are using Unix, follow these steps to make a bootable Rocky Linux 9 ISO with Ventoy
      a. Download Ventoy for linux
         1) Go to https://www.ventoy.net/en/download.html
         2) Select ventoy-1.0.99-linux.tar.gz
         3) In the SourceForge page, click on ventoy-1.0.99-linux.tar.gz
         3) Download it to your Downloads directory

      b. Uncompress it
         unix> cd ~/Downloads
         unix> tar zxvf ventoy-1.0.99-linux.tar.gz
         unix> cd ventoy-1.0.99/

      c. Insert your destination USB drive

      d. Run Ventoy2Disk to install Ventoy to your USB drive
         unix> sudo ./VentoyGUI.x86_64
          1) Select the device that has your USB drive
          2) Press Install
          3) You will be prompted:  "Your device will be formatted and all data will be lost.  Continue?"
             Press "Yes"
          4) You will be prompted:  "Congratulations!  Ventoy has been successfully installed to this device"
             Press OK

      e. Close Ventoy

      f. Install your ISO file to your USB drive using ventoy
         1) Disconnect and re-connect your USB drive
         	NOTE:  Upon re-connect, you should see your USB drive mounted.
                   If you don't see a file explorer, then you might have to try on Windows or later version of linux (like Rocky Linux 9)
         2) Drag and Drop your downloaded Rocky Linux .iso file to your USB drive
	     3) Unmount your USB drive
	     	!!WARNING!!   Wait for you operating system to tell you it's ok to remove the USB drive BEFORE removing the USB drive

	        -- You now have a bootable USB drive that will install Rocky Linux 9

    b. unix> su -
          <Enter the root password>

    c. Run the visudo command as root
       unix> visudo

          # Add this line to the end:
          <your unix username> ALL=(ALL) ALL

    unix> exit       # exit root and become your regular unix account
    unix> sudo -l    # Run this command as your own regular unix account (not as root)

    Now, your personal unix account can run "sudo -s" to become root


 2. Customize your bash shell with a few aliases
    unix> vi ~/.bashrc

      # User specific aliases and functions
      alias c=clear
      alias r='fc -e -'
      alias ls='ls -F'
      alias rls='while [ 1 ]; do clear; date; ls -ltr; sleep 3; done'
      alias x=exit

      # Set bash prompt editing using vi-style
      set -o vi

      # Setup the prompt to show the username, hostname, and working directory
      export PS1='\u@\h $PWD > '


 3. Setup vi defaults
    NOTE:  Add the :syntax off line to your .vimrc

    unix> vi ~/.vimrc
       # Add this to the file
       :syntax off


 4. Increase the maximum number of open files from 1024 to 65535
    Increase the number of inotify user watches from 8192 to 524288
    a. Show max open files
       unix> sudo -s
       unix> ulimit -a | grep 'open file'
             open files      (-n) 1024

    b. Increase the max number of open files to 65536
       unix> vi /etc/sysctl.conf

         # Increase max number of open files
         fs.file-max = 65536

         # Increase the number of user watches
         fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288


       unix> vi /etc/security/limits.conf

         # Increase max number of open files
         *          soft     nproc          65535
         *          hard     nproc          65535
         *          soft     nofile         65535
         *          hard     nofile         65535


   c. Save the changes
      unix> sysctl --system
      unix> sysctl -p

   d. Reboot the operating system
      unix> reboot

   e. Verify the limit is greater by running ulimit again
      unix> sudo -s
      unix> ulimit -a | grep 'open file'
      -- You should see 65535

   f. Verify the number of user watches increased
      unix> cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
      -- You should see 524288

                        unix> sudo reboot

    		WARNING 2:  If the systemd-udev-settle service takes 2 minutes (or longer) on startup, then run these commands to fix it:
    			   unix> sudo systemctl mask systemd-udev-settle
    			   unix> sudo reboot



 3. Fix the problem of the grub2 boot manager not showing  (SKIP THIS STEP if you see the grub2 on powerup)
