How to Restore the Leather Steering Wheel
-----------------------------------------
Problem:  My leather steering wheel looks like shit
Solution: Purchase the "Leather Steering Wheel Repair Kit"

Bottom Line:
 1) After running through the procedures the **FIRST** time, the leather was not dark and it was still not smooth
 2) After running through the procedures the **SECOND** time, the leather was dark and I had to do a final sand with 1600 sand paper smooth it out



Preparation
-----------
 1. Buy some things *BEFORE* you start
    a. Buy the "Delicate Surface" frog tape -- it works well
    b. Buy a small edger with a dowel rod

                    +-------+

    c. Buy 20+ of cheap disposable gloves
    d. Buy additional 320-grid sand paper  (the kit did not come with much)
    e. Buy additional 1600 grid sand paper (the kid does not come with it)
    f. Make sure you have some rags

 2. Put the "Delicate Surface" frog tape around the parts of the steering wheel you want to protect

 3. Buy the Leather Steering Wheel Repair Kit (from furnitureclinic.com)
    https://www.furnitureclinic.com/leather-care-products/leather-steering-wheel-repair-kit

    It comes with the following
		50ml Alcohol Cleaner

		50ml Leather Repair Paint (restores the colour)
		2x Small Sponges
		320 Grit Wet & Dry Sandpaper
		1200 Grit Wet & Dry Sandpaper

Procedure
---------
 1. Apply a 320-grit sand paper / try to make the leather smooth

 2. Apply the cloth & Liquid Degreaser and wipe down the whole surface of the leather
    -- Do this multiple times
    -- At this point, the leather may be fibrous or rough

 3. Apply Alcohol Cleaner with dry cloth

 4. Apply the Leather Binder
    -- Apply it sparingly with PRESSURE
    -- I applied it 6 times

 5. Apply 1200-grid sand paper
    Remove dust with damped cloth & Alcohol Cleaner

 6. Apply Self-Seal Colourant to the steering wheel
    -- Use a light, even, dabbing motion to build up the colour
    -- I applied it 6 times
       NOTE:  Let it dry for 30 minutes between coats

 7. After the final Self-Seal Colourant is applied, feel the steering wheel
    -- I had to use 1600 sand paper to do a very-very-light sanding

 8. Remove the "Delicate Surface" frog tape
    NOTE:  There were no problems removing this tape
