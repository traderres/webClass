How to Use Your Certificate Authority to Make a Client Cert (for Windows)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You already have a Root Certificate Authority Created 
    [see howToUseYourCertAuthority_InitialSetup.txt]
 B) You want to create your own self-signed client certificate in .p12 format



Procedures
----------
 1. Create a Client certificate signing request (CSR) and client key
    CMD> mkdir c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> cd /d c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout client.key -out client.csr
   
    -- You are prompted to enter the following:
        County Name:  [US]          US
        State or Province name:     Virginia
        Locality Name:              Merrifield
        Organization Name:          Secure
        Organizational Unit:        Secure
        Common Name:                John Smith
        Email Address:              <blank>
        A challenge Password:       <blank>
        An optional company name:   <blank>
        
        -- Generates a certificate signing request (called client.csr)
        -- Generates a private key file (called client.key



 2. Sign the Client CSR (generate client.cert.notes)
     CMD> cd /d c:\tools\root-ca
     CMD> openssl ca -batch -config conf/openssl.cnf -in c:\temp\client_cert\client.csr -out c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes
  
          Using configuration from conf/openssl.cnf
          Loading 'screen' into random state - done
          Check that the request matches the signature
          Signature ok
          Certificate Details:

                        stateOrProvinceName       = Virginia
                        organizationName          = Secure
                        organizationalUnitName    = Secure
                        commonName                = John Smith
                    X509v3 extensions:
                        X509v3 Basic Constraints:
                            CA:FALSE

                            serial:E4:59:C3:2F:EF:D6:1B:05
            
                        Netscape CA Revocation Url:
                            https://www.example.com/example-ca-crl.pem
          Certificate is to be certified until Jan  5 03:38:32 2017 GMT (365 days)
            
          Write out database with 1 new entries
          Data Base Updated
      
      
     NOTE:  At this point, your conf\serial file should hold 02      
            At this point, your c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes file should hold your *signed* client certificate
            


 3. Extract the signed client certificate from the c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes              
    a. Open this file with notepad:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes    
    b. Highlight the section between  
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
          
    c. Copy + Paste it into this file:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert
    
 
 
 4. Convert the signed client cert into PKCS12 format
    NOTE:  Your signed client cert should be herE:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert
    CMD> cd /d c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.cert -inkey client.key -out client.p12
         Enter Export Password:              secret
         Verifying - Enter Export Password:  secret
     


 5. Import the signed client certificate into your web browser
    a. Startup Firefox
    b. Pull Tools / Options / Advanced
    c. Click "View Certificates"
    d. Click "Your Certificates" tab
    d. Click "Import"
    e. Browser to where the client.p12 file is located:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.p12
       Enter password from the previous step:  secret
