How to Use Your Certificate Authority to Make a Client Cert (for Windows)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions:
 A) You already have a Root Certificate Authority Created
    [see howToUseYourCertAuthority_InitialSetup.txt]
 B) You want to create your own self-signed client certificate in .p12 format



Procedures
----------
 1. Create a Client certificate signing request (CSR) and client key
    CMD> rd /s /q c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> mkdir    c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> cd /d    c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout client.key -out client.csr

    -- You are prompted to enter the following:
        Country Name:  [US]         US
        State or Province name:     Virginia
        Locality Name:              Merrifield
        Organization Name:          Secure
        Organizational Unit:        Secure
        Common Name:                John Smith                 <-- Change this to your client username
        Email Address:              <blank>
        A challenge Password:       <blank>
        An optional company name:   <blank>

        -- Generates a certificate signing request (called client.csr)
        -- Generates a private key file (called client.key



 2. Sign the Client CSR (generate client.cert.notes)
     CMD> cd /d c:\tools\root-ca
     CMD> openssl ca -batch -config conf/openssl.cnf -in c:\temp\client_cert\client.csr -out c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes

          Using configuration from conf/openssl.cnf
          Loading 'screen' into random state - done
          Check that the request matches the signature
          Signature ok
          Certificate Details:

                        stateOrProvinceName       = Virginia
                        organizationName          = Secure
                        organizationalUnitName    = Secure
                        commonName                = John Smith
                    X509v3 extensions:
                        X509v3 Basic Constraints:
                            CA:FALSE
                        X509v3 Subject Key Identifier:
                            86:CC:8C:A4:EE:06:0A:0E:56:A6:2F:B2:EC:CF:DA:AE:67:7D:8F:95
                        X509v3 Authority Key Identifier:
                            keyid:88:98:A1:46:98:5A:5A:C0:8E:78:32:36:65:E7:D9:6B:25:49:E3:DC

                            https://www.example.com/example-ca-crl.pem
          Certificate is to be certified until Jan  5 03:38:32 2017 GMT (365 days)

          Write out database with 1 new entries
          Data Base Updated


     NOTE:  At this point, your conf\serial file should hold a number *GREATER* than 01  (either 02 or 03)
            At this point, your c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes file should hold your *signed* client certificate



 3. Extract the signed client certificate from the c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes
    a. Open this file with notepad:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert.notes
    b. Highlight the section between
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

          -----END CERTIFICATE-----

    c. Copy + Paste it into this file:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert



 4. Convert the signed client cert into PKCS12 format
    NOTE:  Your signed client cert should be here:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.cert
    CMD> cd /d c:\temp\client_cert
    CMD> openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.cert -inkey client.key -out client.p12
         Enter Export Password:              secret
         Verifying - Enter Export Password:  secret



 5. Import the signed client certificate into your web browser
    a. Startup Firefox
    b. Pull Tools / Options / Advanced
    c. Click "View Certificates"
    d. Click "Your Certificates" tab
    d. Click "Import"
    e. Browser to where the client.p12 file is located:  c:\temp\client_cert\client.p12
       Enter password from the previous step:  secret
