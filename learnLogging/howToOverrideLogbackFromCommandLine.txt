How to Override Logback from Command Line
------------------------------------------
Problem:  I am investigating some java code and want to increase the logging
          I don't want to make a new build
          How can I override one or two java classes to use trace level from the command-line

Solution: Use -Dlogging.level


Example:  I want to increase the logging within the "com.sun.email" package to be "TRACE"
            -Dlogging.level.com.sun.mail=TRACE

Example:  I want to increase the logging within the "javax.mail" package to be "DEBUG"
            -Dlogging.level.javax.mail=DEBUG

Example:  I want to increase both classes to TRACe
            -Dlogging.level.com.sun.mail=TRACE   -Dlogging.level.javax.mail=TRACE
