How to Override Logback from Command Line
------------------------------------------
Problem:  I am investigating some java code and want to increase the logging
          I don't want to make a new build
          How can I override one or two java classes to use trace level from the command-line

Solution: Use -Dlogging.level.<PACKAGE NAME>=<LOG LEVEL>


Example Command Line Arguments
------------------------------
Example #1:  I want to increase the logging within the "com.sun.email" package to be "TRACE"
             -Dlogging.level.com.sun.mail=TRACE

Example #2:  I want to increase the logging within the "javax.mail" package to be "DEBUG"
             -Dlogging.level.javax.mail=DEBUG

Example #3:  I want to increase both classes to TRACe
             -Dlogging.level.com.sun.mail=TRACE   -Dlogging.level.javax.mail=TRACE
