    NOTE:  You will only be presented the token value ONCE
           Record the access token temporarily

    terminal> git clone https://USERID:ACCESS_TOKEN@CLONE_URL
                                                       ^
                                                       |
                                                       |
                                                     If the url is https://www.stuff.com/my-site/stuff/stuff.git
                                                     then the CLONE_URL is www.stuff.com/my-site/stuff/stuff.git


    NOTE:  If you have problems using the regular clone, then....

    Possible Fix #1:
      terminal> git config --global core.compression 0
      terminal> git clone https://USERID:ACCESS_TOKEN@CLONE_URL

    Possible Fix #2:
      Wait an hour and try again!!!  As that has solved the issue


 5. Open the project in IntelliJ

 6. You should be able to create branches and push the branches up
