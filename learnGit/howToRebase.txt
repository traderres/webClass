Procedure
---------
 1. Get the latest development branch   (the branch with other people's changes -- could be "master" or "development")
    unix> git branch -D development       # Delete the development branch
    unix> git fetch -a                    # Get the latest development branch
    unix> git checkout development

 2. Checkout to your local branch

 3. In Intellij, Pull VCS -> Git -> Rebase

 4. In the popup
    a. Uncheck "Interactive"
    b. In the "onto", choose development (or the branch with other people's changes)
    c. Click "Rebase"

 5. Resolve conflicts (if there are any)

 6. Compile it from scratch
    unix> mvn clean package -Pprod


    If it does not compile, fix the errors!!!!


 7. Do a "force push"
    In Intellij, Pull VCS -> Git -> Push -> Force Push
    *OR*
    unix> git push -f    # This will perform a “force push”, which will push your rebased local branch performing the additional merge

    NOTE:  If you do a git status, Git will tell you to do a "pull"
    -- **DO NOT DO A PULL**
    -- THis will cause a second copy of your commits to appear in the history


    THis is the exception to the “always pull, then push” rule.
    When you rebase, you’re creating a copy of your commit history.
    Git treats this new copy of history as a completely different set of commits (because it is).
