Procedure
---------
 1. Get the latest development branch   (the branch with other people's changes)
    unix> git checkout some-other-branch
    unix> git branch -D development       # Delete the development branch
    unix> git fetch -a                    # Get the latest development branch
    unix> git checkout development

 2. Checkout to your local branch
 
 3. In Intellij, Pull VCS -> Git -> Rebase
 
 4. In the popup
    a. Uncheck "Interactive"
    b. In the "onto", choose development (or the branch with other people's changes)
    
 5. Do a "force push"
    NOTE:  If you do a git status, Git will tell you to do a "pull"
    -- DO NOT DO A PULL
    -- THis will cause a second copy of your commits to appear in the history
    
    unix> git push -f    # This will perform a “force push”, which will push your rebased local branch performing the additional merge
    
    THis is the exception to the “always pull, then push” rule.
    When you rebase, you’re creating a copy of your commit history. 
    Git treats this new copy of history as a completely different set of commits (because it is).
