How to Create Gitlab Project from Existing Files
------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I am using git command line 2.27.0 and need to set an initial branch
          When I push my code with
              git push -u origin main

           I get this error:
              error: src refspec main does not match any
              error: failed to push some refs to 'gitlab.rbr-tech.com:RBR-Dev-Team/nccs-training.git'


Solution:
---------
You are attempting to push branch called main
But, your local branch is probably called master

 1. Verify the name of your local branch
    unix> git branch
    * master

 2. Push up the master branch  (not the main branch)
    git push -u origin master
