Part 5 / Configure Git to use your signing key/email address/full name
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Insert your CAC into your card reader

 2. Use the Windows "Manage User Certificates" to get the "thumbprint id" of your CAC certificate [that is used for document signing]
    a. In Windows, search for "manage user certificates"
    b. Run "Manage User Certificates"
    c. Expand Personal -> Certificates
    d. Make the window wider -- so you can see the columns
    e. Sort by "Expiration Date"
       -- You should see your 3 certificates (from your CAC)
       -- Look for the CAC certificate that has the expiration date in the future -- probably April 2025
       -- Look for the CAC certificate that has an "Intended Purpose" of "Secure Email, Document Signing"

    f. Double-click on your CAC cert that has an "Intended Purpose" of "Secure Email, Document Signing"

    g. Click on the "Details" of your CAC Certificate

    h. Scroll Down in the list until you see Thumbprint

    i. Copy the Thumbprint value from the **BOTTOM** of this popup
       -- This is your user.signingkey

 3. Tell Git to use your certificate for this *ONE PROJECT ONLY*
    a. Set the signing key for YOUR project
       terminal> cd ideaProjects\bogus
   	   terminal> git config --local user.signingkey <THE ID FROM THUMBPRINT>

    b. Add these remaining git settings
  	   terminal> git config --local gpg.format x509
       terminal> git config --local gpg.x509.program smimesign
	   terminal> git config --local commit.gpgsign true

 4. Tell git what your email address should be
    terminal> git config --local user.email john.smith@zztop.com          # This email address must match your CAC

 5. Tell git what your full name should be
    NOTE:  Use double quotes  (not apostrophes!!!)
    terminal> git config --local user.name "John Smith"

 6. Verify that GIT settings are correctly set
    terminal> git config --local --list | sort

    You should see:
      commit.gpgsign=true
      ...
      gpg.format=x509
      gpg.x509.program=smimesign
      ....
      user.email=john.smith@zztop.com
      user.name=John Smith
      user.signingkey=123456789123456789



Part 6 / Try your first git commit signing w/cac from command-line
------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Open a terminal

 2. Run these commands:
    terminal> cd ideaProjects\bogus
    terminal> git checkout -b YOUR_INITIALS/test

 3. Make a change to the README.med

 4. Attempt to commit the change
    terminal> git commit -a -m "Test Commit"
    -- You should be prompted to enter your CAC pin

 5. Enter your PIN
    -- After entering your pin, the commit should be accepted

 6. Attempt to push the commit up
    terminal> git push --set-upstream origin YOUR_INITIALS/test
    -- Verify that you see no errors!!!!


 6. Look at the signature in the log
    terminal> git log --show-signature

    You should "Good made using certificate ID...."
    	commit dc9c259b72b8ceb4243c98b946d0d0b3965bd430 (HEAD -> js/my-branch-name, origin/js/my-branch-name)
    	smimesign:  Signature made using certificate ID.....
