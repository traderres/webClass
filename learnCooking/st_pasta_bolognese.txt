Pasta Bolognese
---------------

Hints:
 -- It takes 3 hours start-to-finish  (assuming you take 90 minutes to simmer)
 -- Add olive oil to the pasta at the end (so it does not stick)


I made it on 5/9/2021 and it turned out great:
 -- I used 1 tablespoon of salt and little under 1 tablespoon of pepper
 -- I used 2.4 lbs of hamburger beef  (it was a bit oily at the end)
 -- I used most of a 28 oz jar of crushed tomatoes (so, probably 26 oz)
 -- To reduce the liquidy nature, I simmered without the lid turning the last 20 minutes (and it helped).

Surprise:  It took 17 minutes to cook the fettuccine (need more water)

Bigger Surprise:  It turned out well, but start earlier.
