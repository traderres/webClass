Pan Seared Bacon Wrapped Steak w/Brandy Cream Sauce
---------------------------------------------------
I made this on 4/25/2022 and it was really delicious.


Some Handy Hints from the Chef
------------------------------
 A. When cooking the steak, use canola oil or vegetable oil (not olive oil)
 B. When cutting the carrots, cut at an angle and then rotate  (so you have interesting carrots
 C. When serving the smashed potatoes, stack them (to give the plate some height)
 D. The flaming effect (when adding the 1/4 cut of brandy) is not from the liquid (it's from the brandy vapors)
 

Feedback from the kids
----------------------
They did not like the honey (that was added to the carrots at the end)
