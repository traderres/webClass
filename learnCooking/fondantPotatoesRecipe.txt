Thoughts on the Fondant Potatoes Recipe made on 12/25/2022
----------------------------------------------------------

We made this recipe for the first time last night.
-- Overall, they were pretty good

To make it better:
 1) When cutting-up the potatoes, you want CONSISTENT sized pieces
 2) cut-up the rosemary and put it over the potatoes
 3) When pulling it out of the oven, add some salt
