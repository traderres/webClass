How to Improve Firefox Scrolling
--------------------------------

Problem:  Firefox scrolling is jerky
Solution: Adjust the settings

Procedure
---------
 1. In the url go to about:config
    Press "Accept the Risk and Continue"

 2. Set these settings:
	general.smoothScroll.msdPhysics.enabled			true
	mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount				30
	general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMaxMS	150
	general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMinMS	100
	general.smoothScroll.stopDecelerationWeighting	1

    -- And, the scrolling was better




Before I changed this, I had these (LOUSY) settings
	general.smoothScroll.msdPhysics.enabled			false
	mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount				5
	general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMaxMS	600
	general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMinMS	400
	general.smoothScroll.stopDecelerationWeighting	0.4


After I changed this, I had these (IMPROVED) settings
	general.smoothScroll.msdPhysics.enabled			true
	mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount				30
	general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMaxMS	150
	general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMinMS	100
	general.smoothScroll.stopDecelerationWeighting	1
