Hyperlinks Explained in Angular
-------------------------------

	Case 1:  External Hyperlinks (take the user OUTSIDE of our web app)

				<a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>



	Case 2:  Internal hyperlink to navigate the user to an INTERNAL page route
			 NOTE:  We need the forward slash so it's relative to the root
				<a [routerLink]="'/' + Constants.MY_NEW_PAGE">Go to My New Page</a>


				  To reference the Constants in the HTML, add a class variable that is public:
						public readonly Constants = Constants;




	Case 3:  Hyperlink that runs code
             NOTE:  Sometimes, you want a hyperlink that runs a some code (so it acts like a button)

					<a [routerLink]=[] (click)="this.runSomeCode()">This is an internal link</a>



	Case 4:  Hyperlink that runs code *AND* manually takes the user to another page route

   					<a [routerLink]=[] (click)="this.runSomeCode()">This is an internal link</a>


				Inject the router
					constructor(private router: Router) {}

				Add a method
					public runSomeCode(): void {
						// Run some code

						// navigate to the other page
						this.router.navigate( [Constants.MY_NEW_PAGE]).then();
					}
