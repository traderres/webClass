How to Add HighCharts to your Project
-------------------------------------


Procedure
---------
 1. Install the highcharts NPM packages v11.2.0
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects/angularApp16/frontend
    unix> npm install highcharts@11.2.0


    Verify that highcharts is found in your frontend/package.json
    --  You should see something like this in your frontend/package.json
     	"highcharts": "^11.2.0",


 2.  Edit the package.json
     Remove the carrot from the highcharts version (so it does not get automatically upgraded)
    	"highcharts": "11.2.0",


 3. Delete the frontend/node_modules directory

 4. In Intellij:  Right-click on your package.json -> Run npm Install

 5. Verify your code still compiles
    unix> cd ~/intellijProjects/angularApp16
    unix> mvn clean package -Pprod
