Advanced Form Control Techniques (using Angular Material 16)
------------------------------------------------------------


 1. Problem:  My mat-select dropdown needs to stretch to the widest dropdown option
    Solution: Set panelWidth=""

			<!-- Set panelWidth="" or null to have the dropdown panel grow to the widest option    -->
			<mat-select panelWidth="" formControlName="alertState" placeholder="Disposition">

			<!-- Set panelWidth="auto" to have the dropdown panel match the trigger width          -->
			<mat-select panelWidth="auto" formControlName="alertState" placeholder="Disposition">



 2. Problem:  My dropdown has lots of space below it for an mat-error message.
              But, I want to reclaim that space (but it will expand if an mat-error message is displayed)
    Solution: Use subscriptSizing="dynamic"

			<!-- The subscriptSizing="dynamic" causes the mat-form-field to reclaim the space used by the mat-error -->
			<mat-form-field subscriptSizing="dynamic">

			</mat-form-field>



 3. Problem:  The Angular Material dropdowns and textboxes have so much padding
              How to reduce the density?
    Solution: Create a class called "max-reduced-density" and apply it to the form field

			In the SCSS
			-----------
			@use '@angular/material' as mat;


			:host ::ng-deep .max-reduced-density {
			  /* Tell the form field to use less padding.  Angular Material ranges from 0 (normal) to -5 (less padding)  */
			  @include mat.form-field-density(-5);
			}


			In the HTML
			-----------
			<mat-form-field  class="max-reduced-density">

			</mat-form-field>
