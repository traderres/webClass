Problem:  I have a REST call that requires a user to provide a "Report Name" and "Description" fields
		  What does "required" mean for text fields?


Bigger Problem:  All REST calls are ambiguous to some extent

For the developer, you must be PRECISE on what "required" means for text fields

 A) For small text fields (under 100 chars), consider this:
	What is a required "report name"?

	Here are 6 cases:
	  1) Can the text provided be all spaces?
	  2) Can the text provided by all new lines?
	  3) Can the text provided be all tabs?
	  4) Can the text provided be a mix of spaces/new lines/tabs?
	  5) Can the text provided be NULL?
	  6) Can the text provided be an empty string?


 B) For large text fields, consider this:
 	 What is a required "Description"?
	  1) Can the text provided be all spaces?
	  2) Can the text provided by all new lines?
	  3) Can the text provided be all tabs?
	  4) Can the text provided be a mix of spaces/new lines/tabs?
	  5) Can the text provided be NULL?
	  6) Can the text provided be an empty string?
	  7) Can the text provided be greater than X characters?
	  8) Can the text provided by less than Y characters?
	  9) Should the text provided be SANITIZED?  If so, what does that mean?


General Approaches for Backend Developers
-----------------------------------------
 1) For small text fields, assume that they CANNOT be blank

			if (StringUtils.isBlank( aDTO.getReportName()  ) {
				// This report name is *BLANK*

				// Need to return a message back to the frontend.  Telling them, this ain't right!!
				// Instead of returning a Response status code of 200 [good]
				// We, return a response status code of 400
				return ResponseEntity().status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST)
										.contentType(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
									    .body("Report Name cannot be blank")

			}



 2) For large text fields, it would be better to have a policy that states min/max field length



KEY POINTS
----------
1) All REST Call Contracts are AMBIGUOUS!!!!

2) What is "required" for string fields?
	-- Can it be all spaces?
	-- Can it be only 4 characters?
	-- Can I type-in 4 spaces?

3) What is "required" for the big text boxes?
	-- Can users enter 50,000,000 characters?


4) Does the backend need to "Sanitize" text?
   If so, what does that mean?
	-- Does that mean striping-out anything with an angular bracket?
			<script>...</script>

			<a> this that

			<a>...This that</a>


5) Frontend Form Validation is for *SHOW*
   -- It does not provide any real security

6) Backend REST Call checks on incoming data is *REAL SECURITY*
   -- This is the last chance to stop the user from doing something

   This is why we have a Controller and Service
	-- Controller is about checking the passed-in data
	-- Service is about doing the work


7) Should the backend trim every text field before saving to the database?
	"  Report #1   "

	-- Should the backend trim it down to "Report #1"
