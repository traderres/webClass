Boring Lecture / What is an Observable?
---------------------------------------
An observable is a "lazy" stream of data.
-- We can push things onto the stream
-- We can listen for events in the stream.
-- We can transform the stream to another stream



Characteristics of an observable
---------------------------------
 A) Observables are lazy:  They only send to subscribers

 B) If you don't subscribe, then nothing happens

 C) Observables can have multiple values over time
    The sender decides when you get it but all you have to do is just wait until it comes out
    -- User clicking on keys in a textbox is an observable we can listen on
       Click "A"  -->  Click "B" --> Click "C"

 D) Observables are cancellable (using the unsubscribe() method)
    You can't cancel a promise

 E) Observables are producers of multiple items, "pushing" them to subscribers
