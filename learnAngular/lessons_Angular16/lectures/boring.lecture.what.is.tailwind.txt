What is Tailwind?
-----------------
It is:
 1) type of css
 2) time saving
 3) Level of abstraction for css

			<span style="font-weight: bold">
				THis is bold
			</span>


			<span class="font-bold">
				This is bold
			</span>




What is tailwind?
-----------------
	1. A big bunch of utility CSS classes

	2. Whenever you add a CSS framework to you webapp, you're adding weight

	3. Comes with a post-processor
		-- Instead of including EVERY css class
		-- It only includes those CSS classes that we're using

	4. It's also got strong CSS supports for layouts
		-- Google created Angular
		-- Google is PUSHING developers to stop using angluar-flex for layouts and instead use tailwind

			Angular Flex works with Angular 2-14
			Angular Flex does not work with Angular 15, 16, ...

	5. By using Tailwind for layouts, we don't need Angular Flex anymore
		+ Less weight
		+ Pages load faster
		+ Compiles faster (without angular flex)




	Weakness of other CSS frameworks:
	---------------------------------
	Lots of classes --> more stuff to load into your browser --> Slower page load

			<HTML>
				-- You have to include the bootstrap css in to your main page --  2000 CSS classes

			</HTML>



			<HTML>
				<div style="padding: 20px; margin: 10px">

				</div>

				<div class="p-5    m-2.5">
					<!-- 1 unit ---> 4px      -->
					<!-- 2.5 units --> 10px   -->
                    <!-- 5   units --> 20px   -->
				</div>

				<div class="m-[11px]">

				</div>


			</HTML>
