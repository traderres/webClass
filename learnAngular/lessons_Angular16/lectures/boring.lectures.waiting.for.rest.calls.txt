PROBLEM:  How do we keep users from going anywhere while WAITING for a long-running REST call  (3 seconds or more)
SOLUTION: Use a dialog and keep it open while REST call is running\

			   -- When the user presses "Submit" in the dialog

					1) Freeze the dialog  [so that pressing Escape or clicking outside of it does NOTHING]
					2) Show a spinner     [let the user know that a REST call is running]
					3) Disable the Reset and Submit buttons in the dialog
					4) Invoke the REST call

						-- The user is ESSENTIALLY STUCK on this dialog until the REST call finishes


					5) When the REST Call finishes successfully or failure
						-- Close the dialog and let the caller know if it worked or failed


By using a dialog, we get a number of benefits:
  A) The user cannot navigate to other pages   [all links will not work]
  B) The user cannot click on any of thousands of records in a grid  [all links will not work
  C) There are only 2 buttons that I need to disable:  The reset and submit buttons [in the dialog itself]
