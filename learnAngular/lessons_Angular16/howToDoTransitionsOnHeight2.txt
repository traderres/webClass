How to do Transitions on Height
-------------------------------
Problem:  I want to hide a div vertically on a page using animation
Solution: Use Tailwind's CSS classes
          WARNING:  It requires the parent height to be set. So, you need h-full or style="height: 100%" on the parent divs


Assumptions:
 A) Suppose you have some div that you want to show/hide with animation

		<button type="button" (click)="this.toggleSection()">Show/Hide Section</button>


 		<!-- Div that can vertically appear/disappear with animation -->
 		<div>
 			<ul>
 				<li><span>How to use this page </span></li>
 				<li>* Some text that users don't want to read</li>
 				<li>* Some even more silly text</li>
 				<li>* Some even more silly text</li>
 			</ul>
 		</div>




Procedure
---------

 1. In the Typescript class, add a class variable that holds the flag whether the right-side-is-expanded

     public showSection: boolean = true;



 2. In the Typescript class, add a click handler that will toggle the flag

	  public toggleSection(): void {
		this.showSection = !this.showSection;
	  }



 3. Add the click handler to the button
		<button type="button" (click)="this.toggleSection()">
			Show/Hide Section
		</button>



 4. Add 2 css classes

	.show-content {
	  	@apply transition-all ease-in-out duration-300;
	}

	.hide-content {
		/* Set the height to zero */
	  	@apply transition-all ease-in-out duration-300 h-0 overflow-hidden;
	}



 5. In the HTML, change the right-side div to conditionally apply a class
    WARNING:  The right-side div must have an initial width for this to work:  so the w-1/3 is important



	<div  [ngClass]="{ 'show-content': this.showCompanyInfo,
    	               'hide-content': !this.showCompanyInfo}">
 			<ul>
 				<li><span>How to use this page </span></li>
 				<li>* Some text that users don't want to read</li>
 				<li>* Some even more silly text</li>
 				<li>* Some even more silly text</li>
 			</ul>
 		</div>
