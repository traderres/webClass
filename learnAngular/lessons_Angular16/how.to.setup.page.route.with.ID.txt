How to Setup a Page Route that has an ID in it
----------------------------------------------
Problem:  My details page requires an ID to be passed-in


Solution
--------
 1. Generate a component (as usual)
    

 2. Add a constant for it (but add a trailing slash)

            MY_DETAILS_ROUTE                   = "page/details/",


 3. Register with app.module.ts (but include ':id')
	a. Edit app.module.ts
    
    b. Add this entry: 
				 { path:  Constants.MY_DETAILS_ROUTE + ':id',            component: MyDetailsPageComponent,           canActivate: [ PageGuard.canActivate ]},



 4. Add a database record that matches app.module.ts

		insert into uicontrols(id, name) values(3102, 'page/details/:id');  




Why do it this way?
-------------------
 1) We can use router.navigate() as usual  [but we need to pass-in a 2nd argument]:

	// Take the user to the details page and pass-in ID of 25
	this.router.navigate( [Constants.MY_DETAILS_ROUTE, 25] );


 2) The page guard still works correctly

 3) Someone looking at the uicontrols table would understand that there is a passed-in id:
