How to Debug an Existing Spring Boot / Angular Web App
------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I just cloned the spring boot / angular web app.  How do I debug it in IntelliJ?



Procedure
---------
 1. Startup IntelliJ and open the angularApp1 project

 2. Create this configuration:   "Backend (dev)"
    a. Find the main Application java class (that has the @SpringBootApplication annotation)
       1) Go to backend/src/main/java/com/lessons/Application
    
    b. Right-click on the Application.java -> Debug 'Application'
       NOTE:  This will create a debug option called 'Application'  [because that's the name of the class]
    
    c. Pull Run -> Stop 'Application'
    
    d. Pull Run -> Edit Configurations
       a. Single-click on "Application"
       b. On the right-side, select the Configuration tab
       c. Change the name to "Backend (dev)"
       d. In the Environment section
             Program arguments:  -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
       e. Press OK
       
     
 3. Create this configuration:   "Angular CLI Server"
    a. Pull Run -> Edit Configurations
       Select +   -> NPM

       In the window on the right:
         Name:              Angular CLI Server
         Package.json:      ~/intellijProjects/angularApp1/frontend/package.json
         Command:           run
         Scripts:           start
         Arguments:
         Node interpreter:  ~/.nvm/versions/node/v12.5.0/bin/node
         Node options:
         Package manager:   Project
         Environment

     b. Press Apply
     c. Press OK


 4. Create this configuration:   "Angular Application"
     a. Pull Run / Edit Configuration
        Select +   ->  JavaScript Debug

        In the window on the right:
          Name:           Angular Application
          URL:            http://localhost:4200
          Browser:        Chrome
          Check           "Ensure breakpoints are detected when loading scripts"

     b. Press Apply
     c. Press OK


 4. Verify that the "Angular Application" and "Angular CLI Server" work
    a. Browse to frontend/src/app/app.component.ts
    b. Set a breakpoint on line 9 by clicking to the right of the line number.  The line should have this on it:
           title = 'frontend';

    c. Select "Angular CLI Server" and press the "Run" icon
       -- Wait for it to finish

    d. Select "Angular Application" and press the "Debug" icon"
       -- It should startup a Chrome browser connected to http://localhost:4200
       -- You should hit your breakpoint
       -- Press the "Continue" button (or F9)

    c. If it works, Pull Run -> Stop -> Stop All



 5. Setup the multirun plugin (so that you can debug the entire frontend/backend application with one click)
    a. Install the multirun plugin
       1) Pull File -> Settings
       2) Click Plugins
       3) In the Plugins search box, type-in multirun
       4) Click the "install" button [on the right side]
       5) You will be prompted, "JetBrains is not responsible for any processing of your personal data by any third-party plugin vendors"
          Click Accept
       6) Restart IntelliJ

    b. Configure a MultiRun configuration to kick off the backend, the Angular CLI Server, *and* the Angular Application configurations
       1) Pull Run / Edit Configurations...
	   
       2) Press +  ->  MultiRun

	   3) In the window on the right
             Name:  Full WebApp

             Under "Choose configurations to run",
               press +  Backend
               press +  Angular CLI Server
               press +  Angular Application

             Check    "Start configurations one by one" with delay of 9 seconds
             Uncheck  "Mark the tab of failed configuration"
             Uncheck  "Close tab of successfully completed configuraitons"
             Check    "Allow re-using tabs with succeeded run configurations"
             Check    "Allow re-using tabs with failed run configurations"


             NOTE:  Make sure the order is the same order as listed above
                    We want the backend to start *first*

        3) Press Apply
        4) Press OK

    c. Verify that it works
       1) Pull Run -> Debug 'Full Webapp'
       2) Press the "Debug" icon
          -- A chrome browser should appear connected to http://localhost:4200

	   3) Change the url on your browser to http://localhost:8080/app1/api/time
	      -- You should see the time

    d. Pull Run / Stop MultiRun
