How to Set Html on a Component from a Variable
----------------------------------------------
Problem:  I have a variable with some HTML and I want to display it
Solution: Use the innerHTML attribute


Procedure
---------
 1. In your typescript file
       public myHtml: string = 'this is some html<br/> and this is <b>bold</b>';
       
 2. Add a div and set the innerHTML
       <div [innerHTML]="this.myHtml"></div>
       
       
 Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it
 -- So, angular removes any <script> tags
 -- Angular keeps safe content such as the <b> element.
