Lesson:  How to do Server Side Filtering with the Angular Grid
--------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  You have millions (or more) records that you want to filter
          and you DON'T want to filter them in the web browser

Solution: When the user applies a filter, run a REST call and return the first page of those matching records


Advantages
 + Scales-up well (assuming that your data provider is fast -- e.g., ElasticSearch)
 + Few records are sent to the browser (preferable 50 or fewer)
 + The filtering will be quite fast

Disadvantages
 - Requires the front-end to construct a REST call that applies filters, sorting, starting-record-number, and page size
 - Requires the back-end to have a REST call that uses filters, sorting, starting-record-number, and page size
 - Requires knowledge of how to apply filters, sorting, starting-record-number, and page size to ElasticSearch or SQL database
