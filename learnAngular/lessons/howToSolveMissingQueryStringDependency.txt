Problem:  I cannot compile my Angular 9 webapp because querystring is missing
          Angular Compiler says:  Module not found:  Error:  Can't resolve 'querystring"

Solution: We added querystring to the package.json

Procedure
---------
 1. Add querystring as a dependency
    unix> cd frontend
    unix> npm install querystring

    -- This should update the package.json
      	  "querystring": "^0.2.1",


 2. Remove the carrot from the line in the package.json
     		"querystring": "0.2.1",

 3. Attempt to compile the frontend
    -- It works!!!
