Lesson:  How to ensure that a bookmarked page opens the navbar with the correct navgroups opened/closed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  If a user opens a route from a bookmark, then the navgroups are not opened
            Going to http://localhost:4200/page/addReport 
	          -- should open the Reports navgroup 
	          -- should close the other navgroups
            -- should show the "Add Report" item as active
            
Approach:
 A) Inject the Router into the navbar.component.ts
 B) Listen (or subscribe) to router events
 C) If a NavigationEnd event is detected then
    -- Look at the event url
	-- If the event url is for a report page, 
	      then open the Reports navbar group and close the others
		  
	-- If the event url is for an analytics page, 
	      then open the Analytics navbar group and close the others


Procedure       
---------
 1. Modify the navbar.component.ts
 
 2. Add a private variable with the routeSubscription:
		private routeSubscription: Subscription;
	   
 3. In the ngOnDestroy() method, make sure you unsubscribe
		public ngOnDestroy(): void {
			this.routeSubscription.unsubscribe();
		} 
		
 4. In the constructor(), inject the Router and listen for events
	   constructor(private router: Router) {
			this.routeSubscription =  router.events.pipe(
			  	filter(event => event instanceof NavigationEnd)
			).subscribe((event: NavigationEnd) => {
				  // The user has navigated to a different page (or opened a new browser to that page)

				  if ((event.url == '/page/addReports') || (event.url == '/page/viewReports') ) {
					// User is going to one of the Report navbar pages
					this.analyticsGroupClosed = true;
					this.reportsNavGroupClosed = false;
				  }
				  else if ((event.url == '/page/chart1') || (event.url == '/page/chart2') ) {
					// User is going to one of the Analytics navbar pages
					this.analyticsGroupClosed = false;
					this.reportsNavGroupClosed = true;
				  }
			});
	  }
