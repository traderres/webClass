What is an observable?
----------------------
Answer 1:  data stream that pushes data over time
Answer 2:  functions that give multiple values over time  (either async or sync)


Observables are lazy -- i.e., you must *subscribe* to them to get results
Observables are cancelable:  By calling unsubscribe
Observables provide many operators:  map, filter, 
Observables handle multiple values (unlike promises)
 

Observables have 4 phases
 1. Creation:     Sometime a REST call. 
 2. Subscription: We activate the rest call and listen for the results
                  We listen for changes in a form
                  We listen for a selection change in a dropdown
 3. Execution
 4. Destruction.
