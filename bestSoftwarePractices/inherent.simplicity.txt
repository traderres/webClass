Inherent Simplicity
-------------------

Newton said, "Nature is exceedly simple and harmoinious with itself."


Inherent Simplicity
-------------------
Any part of reality is goverened by *few* elements
Any existing conflict can be eliminated


Obstacles
---------
 a) Perception that reality is complex
 b) Tendency to accept conflicts as a given
 c) We tend to blame the other party (blaming others pours fuel on the fire)


Conflict is a situation where we want a contradiction

Reality does not contain contradictions but it is filled with conflicts


People tend to repress chronic problems
-- These are problems that they have given up on the possibility of solving
-- Inherent simplicity says that these can problems *CAN* be solved because the problems are the result of a root conflict
