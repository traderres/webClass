Lessons from R
--------------
R was a super Java programmer.  But, he also whined a lot when requirements were not handed to him on a silver platter.


Lessons
-------
 1) Get the win.  It's more important to get the short-term win now (instead of waiting 12 months to get a long-term win)
 2) If you have a clear, then you're expected to use it.  You can't have a clear and then be unwilling to go to the client site
 3) Don't whine about lack of requirements 6 months into a task
 4) Grass is not always greener:  If you move off your troubled project, you might find that the new project is even worse
 5) Keep mgmt informed when tasks take longer than expected:  They want assurances when things are going poorly.  Getting defensive does not help.
 6) Get out of your chair:
    If you need info, you have a choice:
       (a) Complain that you don't have info or
       (b) Go out and find it.
    R would always choose the (a) option.  The whining got tiresome.
