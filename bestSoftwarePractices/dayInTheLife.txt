A day in the Life of a Professional Programmer
-----------------------------------------------


Description of the type of work you do each day
 + half of the day is spending on my own programming tasks
   a. Working on the Search Engine code, working on the java code, working on the HTML/JavaScript code
   b. Working on new features or fixing bugs on existing features

 + half of the day is spent on non-programming tasks -- e.g.,
      meetings with management, meetings with customers to get clarification, meetings w/developers,
      reviewing other developer's code
      dealing with build issues
      helping out co-workers

Work environment
----------------
+ Open bull pen with 8 developers in a 4 deep row.
+ I get a window spot
+ Not a lot of privacy, but that's by design:  If someone needs to talk to you, they walk up to you and talk to you
+ It's pretty quiet as most developers wear headphones
+ Multiple foos ball tables in the office
+ Free soda fountain, free chips, free candy at the office
+ Very loose dress environment:  Some developers wear shorts and flip flops.  I wear this:  blue jeans and a shirt.  My boss does not actually care what I wear.



Reasons for choosing this field
+ I've always been good with computers growing up.  My parents recognized that when I was a teenager.
+ I enjoy writing programs.
+ Programming plays to my strength.  So, my regular level appears extraordinary to someone else
+ The programmers are the last people to get fired
+ The programmers are often the best paid on the project
+ The programmers are respected by their piers by their ability to create things out of code
+ The programmers have something to show at the end of the day -- e.g., a feature works, a button can be pressed to do something


Skills needed to perform this career
+ Ability to keep learning new technology every 3 years
+ Ability to learn from people who are 20 years younger than you
+ Ability to play well with others -- no one likes working with an asshole
+ Persistence:  Never give up trying to solve a problem
+ Helps to be good at math



Training/education required
+ Bachelor's in Computer Science or Engineering is often required to get in the door
  Exception:  If you know a close friend in a small company and that friend has serious influence and can vouch for you
+ A company views someone who has earned a BS degree as someone who has put in the time to learn the fundamentals




Job Satisfaction
+ Pretty damn high.  I like what I do.  I like writing code and making new systems from scratch.
+ I'm a kid still playing with legos (the only difference is that the legos change every 3 years)


High school coursework necessary to prepare for this career
+ Helps to be a fast typists.  (People think you're smart if you can type fast)
+ Good grades -- so you can get a bachelor's degree in CS or engineering
+ Programming class -- and really liking it


Concluding thoughts
+ Salary:  Imagine a really, really good salary.  And, then double it.
+ But, truth be told, I would do this job for less because I enjoy it
+ My days go by fast (I'm never bored, often deal with lots of problems/issues).
+ Great Tech Job = Good co-workers + Supportive management + Great salary + Fun technology
  You never get everything all 4.  The "good co-workers" is the most important part.
