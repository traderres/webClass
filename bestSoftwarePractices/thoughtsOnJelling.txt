Thoughts on "Jelling"
---------------------
How do we get developers to jel?  Teams that jel are incredibly productive.

Tom DeMcaro and Tim Lister attempted to answer this question.  They did not come up with an answer.


Teamicide  (Ideas that *prevent* teams from jelling)
---------
 1. Defensive Management -- e.g., management does not trust its people.
    -- People who feel untrusted have little inclination to bond together into a cooperative team

 2. Bureaucracy -- e.g., mindless paper pushing
    -- The team needs to believe in some goal
    -- That goal can be arbitrary, but it must exists
    -- There has to be some evidence that management believes in it, too.

 3. Physical Separation
    -- Putting the team together gives them the opportunity for the casual interaction
       that is necessary for team formation

 4. Fragmentation of time -- e.g., people working on multiple projects
    -- No one can be part of multiple jelled teams.
    -- The tight interactions of the jelled team are exclusive

 5. The quality-reduced product -- e.g., delivering lower-quality products to get it out now
    -- Delivering low-quality products can be painful for developers.
    -- Developers self-esteem and enjoyment are undermined
    -- Co-developers building a shoddy product don't even want to look each other in the eye
       At the end of the project, they'll make every effort to separate themselves from
       other members of the project

 6. Phony Deadlines
    -- In the typical arrangement, the manager announced that the work must be done on a certain date.
       The date mentioned is impossible to meet and everyone know it.
       The effort will certainly slip
       The work has been defined in such a way that success is impossible.
       The message to workers is clear:  The boss believes that they won't do any work except under duress.

 7. Team separation at the end of a project
    -- Teams cannot jel when they are separated at the end
