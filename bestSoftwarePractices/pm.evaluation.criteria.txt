PMs are evaluated on 3 things
-----------------------------
    1. How well PMs takes care of their people
    2. How well PMs take care of their clients (you have to impress them / over-deliver)
    3. how much PMs have increased revenue / profit

Dirty secret:  #1 and #2 are expected.  #3 is what they are really measured on.
