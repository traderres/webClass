How To run Network Cable Through the House
------------------------------------------


Materials Needed
----------------
 1) Friends -- it's a hard job to do by yourself 
 2) Network Cable -- e.g., exterior rated cat6 cable
 3) Caulk / Silicone  (used to plug-in exterior holds)
 4) Caulk Gun
 5) Inexpensive plastic gloves (once you apply caulk, use your fingers to smooth out the caulk)

 6) Plastic clips to attach cable to the wall
    NOTE:  Make sure clips are the same color as the cable

11) 3/4" drill bit about 16" in length  (perfect width for running cable through holes and long enough to go through walls)
12) Measuring tape
13) Ratches screw driver
14) String  (to pull the cable through small holes)



Tricks & Techniques
-------------------
 1. When drilling an exterior hole, aim down 

          inside |
                 |
                 | outside    

    Have the hole face down so that rain does not flow in



 2. Verify that your new cable works *BEFORE* starting the project
    -- Connect it directly between your router and laptop
    -- Verify it works *BEFORE* you start

 3. Half way through, verify that your new cable still works
