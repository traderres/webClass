How to Get Breakpoints to work with Intellij 2021.2.24 and Chrome 111
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  Chrome update to v111 stops breakpoints from working in the front-end
Fix:      Tell IntelliJ to start up Chrome with the --remote-allow-origins=*
          In the JavaScript Debug option, uncheck the checkbox called "Ensure breakpoints are detected when loading scripts"


Procedure
---------
 1. Startup IntelliJ

 2. Setup Chrome to run with the  --remote-allow-origins=*
    a. Pulls File -> Settings
    b. Selected Tools -> Web Browsers and Preview
    c. Select "Chrome" and press the "Edit" icon  (looks like a pencil)
    d. In the "Change settings" popup
       Command Line option:
           --remote-allow-origins=*

 3. Adjust "Angular Application"
    a. Pull Run -> Edit Configurations
    b. Single-click on JavaScript Debug -> Angular Application
    c. Unchecked "Ensure breakpoints are detected when loading scripts"
    d. Press OK


 4. Try out the full debugger
    -- Chrome should startup and connect to localhost:4200
    -- Breakpoints should be working
