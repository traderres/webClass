How to Get Breakpoints to work with Intellij 2021.2.24 and Chrome 111
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  Chrome update to v111 stops breakpoints from working in the front-end
Fix:      Tell IntelliJ to start up Chrome with the --remote-allow-origins=*
          In the JavaScript Debug option, uncheck the checkbox called "Ensure breakpoints are detected when loading scripts"
