How to Get Breakpoints to work with Intellij 2021.2.24 and Chrome 111
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  Chrome update to v111 stops breakpoints from working in the front-end
Fix #1:   Tell IntelliJ to start up Chrome with the --remote-allow-origins=*
Fix #2:   Downgrade to Chrome v110  (yeah, that's a crappy solution!!)

Procedure
---------
 1. Startup IntelliJ

 2. Setup Chrome to run with the  --remote-allow-origins=*
    a. Pulls File -> Settings
    b. Selected Tools -> Web Browsers and Preview
    c. Select "Chrome" and press the "Edit" icon  (looks like a pencil)
    d. In the "Change settings" popup
       Command Line option:
           --remote-allow-origins=*

       Check "Use custom user data directory"
       NOTE:  This ensures that Chrome keeps overwriting the user data directory (instead of creating LOTS of new ones sucking up disk space)

    d. Press OK

 3. Try out the full debugger
    -- Chrome should startup and connect to localhost:4200
    -- Breakpoints should be working
