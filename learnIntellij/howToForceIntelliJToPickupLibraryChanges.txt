How to force intellij to pickup your latest core-library
--------------------------------------------------------
Problem:  I have changed the core-library but IntelliJ does not pickup the changes



Procedure
---------
 1. Erase the core-library.jar from your .m2/repository
    terminal> rd /s /q c:/users/%USERNAME%/.m2/repository/gov/dcsa

 2. In your intellij project (that is using the core-library), refresh
    a. Open the intellij project
    b. Pull pom.xml -> Maven -> Reload
       -- You should get an error  [because it cannot find the core-library jar]

 3. Compile & Install the core library
    terminal> cd ideaProjects/core-library
    terminal> mvn clean install

 4. Tell your other project to pick-up the latest core library
    a. Open the intellij project
    b. Pull pom.xml -> Maven -> Reload
       -- You should be good now
